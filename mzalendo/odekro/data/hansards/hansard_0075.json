The recent oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is a clear reminder of what can happen. And that is why it is very important that institutions like the Environmental Protection Agency and others must have the capacity and the people to do the work in a way that will protect all of us.\n Madam Speaker, it is also very important to point out that as we talk about greening this environment, it is simply not doing it. But it is a real potential for job opportunities and empowerment of our own people. And I think that if we look for that right mix, we will see that we are not only simply protecting the environment but we are really creating jobs and giving an opportunity to our people. I think it calls for this Parliament to really continue to explore the kind of legislations that will strengthen the institutions that are in the forefront of this fight.\n It also calls for punitive sanctions for violations of our environmental rules. I think one of the things that we have not done very well, that others have also to do, is to always remember that the only thing that people will really pay attention to, is where they violate rules and they are brought to account. We must hit companies and organizations that violate environmental laws, hit them well and hurt their pockets and their bottom line. And I think that is very, very important.\n Madam Speaker, the issue of climate change is real. There has been an argument about whether or not climate change is real. Madam Speaker, it is very real and as a country, we must begin to take the steps that others have taken, so that we can protect, not only our\n\ngeneration but the next generation.

What the new clause is trying to say, is that the provisions of Part 1 to 5 on communicable diseases, vaccination, quarantine and vector control apply to animals. So where then is the difference, when you take vaccination?\n I think that we are dealing with public health, which relates to human beings. Why then do we lump in the health of animals, mixed them together to come out with a law, a law that would cover the health of animals and the health of -' where we have defined \"animals\" to include \"vermin\". \"Vermin\" includes cockroaches, worms, all manner of things, and we are looking at public health. Is he telling me that we are looking at public health in relation to cockroaches? I am at a loss; I am completely at a loss.\n Mr Speaker, if we are removing animals from this particular Bill, let us say so, because there is an existing law on diseases and health control relating to animals. That law is there.

There is an existing law, which is Act 83 -- Diseases of Animals Act of 1961. The difficulty is managing it. So What this Bill seeks to do is to create a common platform for managing them.
