        "body": "<p><strong>Plant Breeders&rsquo; Rights Bill : Departmental response to Parliamentary Legal Advisers&#39; concerns</strong><br />\r\nMs Noluthando Netnou-Nkoana, Registrar for Plant Breeders&rsquo; Rights: Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) took the Committee through the clauses of the Plant Breeders Rights Bill (PBRB or the Bill) on which the Parliamentary Legal Advisers had previously made comments.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Clause 10(2)(a)</em><br />\r\nThere had been a request that flowers and flowers fruit be specifically excluded. The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) envisaged that all exceptions would be covered in the Regulations after extensive consultations with all stakeholders. The intention was for the Minister to prescribe conditions for payment of royalties, but not the amounts. Categories of farmers, crops, and uses would be defined in the Regulations, after extensive consultations with stakeholders. DAFF was in agreement with comments from the Parliamentary Legal Advisers that there was no restriction or problem created by clause 10&nbsp; (2)(a).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Clause 11 </em><br />\r\nThis clause had to do with the exhaustion of plant breeders&rsquo; rights. The comment had been made that the clause should make it clear that legislators do not wish to exclude an owner from charging per plant plus a production royalty and other fees as appropriate. DAFF said this was relevant in relation to the notion of &ldquo;sold or otherwise marketed by the breeder or with his consent&rdquo;. The right would not be exhausted when material of the variety had been sold or otherwise marketed without the breeders&rsquo; consent. DAFF was in agreement with the comments of the Parliamentary Legal Advisers that the protection and limitation in clause 11 did not extend to varieties that are already in the market. The exhaustion clause aimed to prevent breeders from collecting royalties more than once.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Clause 15</em><br />\r\nThis clause spoke about varieties in respect of which plant breeders&rsquo; rights may be granted (varieties of recent creation). DAFF stated that this Bill offered protection, as stipulated in UPOV Convention of 1991 Art 6 (2) (giving international protection for new varieties of plants), in respect of any variety of all plant genera and species. DAFF was in agreement with comments from the Parliamentary Legal Advisers that this Bill was fully compliant with the international law.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Clause 19</em><br />\r\nThis clause dealt with the rejection of an application. It was submitted that sections 11 (g) and (i) of the 1976 Act should be retained, and not be omitted. The Parliamentary Legal Advisers wanted to know how the application of a plant breeder&rsquo;s right would be rejected. In response, DAFF stated that clause 19(1) provided for conditions that may lead to an application being rejected. Clause 19(2) provided for the registrar to inform the applicant of the rejection and state the reasons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Clause 21</em><br />\r\nThis clause dealt with the amendment of an application. The comment had been made that the requirement that the description of the variety may not be amended would be too onerous. DAFF responded that if an amendment of an application affected the description of the variety, it could create uncertainty around the true identity of the variety. The Parliamentary Legal Advisers indicated that DAFF was not providing clarity in that it was not offering a way forward, and this is a technical and policy concern. DAFF was suggesting that this clause now be redrafted to indicate that if an amendment would affect the description of the variety, the filing date of the application shall be the date the registrar accepted the amendment, and the registrar must re-publish the application in amended form.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Clause 52</em><br />\r\nThis dealt with offences and penalties. Comment had been made about the minimum and maximum monetary value of the fine. The response from DAFF was that the intention was for the fines to be aligned to the Adjustment of Fines Act (Act 101 of 1991). The Parliamentary Legal Advisers commented that the wording section 51(3) raised a concern of whether the Minister of Justice needed to be consulted, in view of the fact that this was a justice issue. DAFF, in response, stated that it had scheduled a meeting with the Office of the Chief State Law Adviser, and would be in a position to respond comprehensively during the September deliberations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Clause 51(3) read with 52(1)</em><br />\r\nThis clause continued to deal with offences and penalties. A submission had been made to the effect that clauses 51(3) and 52(1) were fundamentally flawed and in conflict with the fundamental human and constitutional rights, and national and international intellectual property legislation,. However, DAFF did not agree that this clause was in conflict with the Constitution, and also thought that it was not correct that the provisions were in conflict with the national and international laws. DAFF was in agreement with the comments from the Parliamentary Legal Advisers which stated that the Minister was legislatively empowered to set a threshold penalty for the relevant authority who would be convicting and sentencing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Clause 52</em><br />\r\nThis clause also dealt with offences and penalties. The comment had been made that clause 52(1)(b) made infringement of the Plant Breeders&#39; rights a criminal offence and required government to police and enforce these rights. DAFF responded to this comment by pointing out that prosecutions were instituted by the National Prosecuting Authority. Prosecutions would only be instituted if there was sufficient evidence of an alleged offence. It further stated that the clause protected those breeders who may not be able to go the civil route, due to the expensive nature of civil cases. DAFF was in agreement with the opinion of the Parliamentary Legal Advisers that clause 52(1)(b) read with 52(1)(a) created a statutory offence. However, this offence required no further policing capacity, as suggested by the submission, and instead the contravention would easily be detected through appropriate administrative functions and taken through the prosecuting processes where necessary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>General Comments</em><br />\r\nComments had been made on the definition of the word &ldquo;breeder&rdquo;. There had been a suggestion that the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; be amended to &ldquo;person(s)&rdquo; to allow for plurality. The Parliamentary Legal Advisers commented that according to drafting standards and the Interpretation Act, a plural form equally refers to singular phrasing. DAFF agreed not to amend the definition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn regard to the definition of &ldquo;sell&rdquo;, it was commented that &ldquo;expose for sale&rdquo; was extremely wide and could introduce grounds for a legal dispute. This also included &ldquo;exchange or otherwise dispose of to any person in any manner&rdquo; as it was also viewed as too wide. It was suggested that this phrase should be followed with &ldquo;excluding testing purposes&rdquo;. The Parliamentary Legal Advisers suggested the insertion of &ldquo;a disposal for some form of consideration&rdquo;. DAFF agreed to amend the definition as suggested.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Clause 46</em><br />\r\nThis clause covered the entering of premises, and comment had been made that clause 46(6), which allows the Registrar to search any premises with consent from a Plant Breeder&rsquo;s Right holder, should be replaced with the wording used in section 24A(6) of the 1976 Act. The comments from the Parliamentary Legal Advisers maintained that these two provisions conveyed the same message. They enabled entry into premises without a warrant but with the consent of the owner or authorised person. This was lawful and constitutional. DAFF indicated that the two provisions were slightly different, since the wording used in clause 46(6) provided for consent from the Plant Breeder&rsquo;s Right holder, while Section 24(6) wording seemed to provide for consent from the person who was competent to allow entry at the place to be searched.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Retention of sections of 1976 Act</em><br />\r\nIt was further commented that Section 31 of the 1976 Act should be retained as it may become important for food security or in the public interest in the future. DAFF agreed with the comments from the Parliamentary Legal Advisers that section 31 of the current Act amounted to expropriation. The Expropriation Bill currently before Parliament was encompassing such intentions, so there was no need to repeat it in this Bill.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Plant Improvement Bill Presentation</strong><br />\r\nDr Botlhe Modisane, Chief Director: Animal Production and Health: DAFF, took the Committee through the clauses of the Plant Improvement Bill (PIB or the Bill).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Clause 38</em><br />\r\nDr Modisane noted that this clause spoke about the evaluation of a variety of plant for value, cultivation and use. DAFF was in agreement with the comments from the Parliamentary Legal Advisers that this clause was aimed at clarifying doubts and for the benefit of the public, because it would enable the Registrar to intervene and make an evaluation that determined the value of that variety, based on the expertise and knowledge that could be used comparatively to reach a fair value and to know if the variety is harmful. DAFF further suggested that the word &ldquo;investigate&rdquo; used in clauses 38(2) and 38(8) should be replaced with &ldquo;evaluate/evaluation&rdquo; (as appropriate) because it was not an investigation but an evaluation of the variety.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Clause 43</em><br />\r\nThis clause dealt with the import of plants and propagating material. The comment of the Parliamentary Legal Advisers noted that there had been concerns expressed about destroying imported goods without compensation, which could amount to unfair deprivation since there was presently no qualifier whether such material would be harmful to the Republic. DAFF indicated that clause 43(8)(a) stated, &ldquo;taking into account the preference of importer&rdquo;. Therefore, it was giving a choice to the importer either to agree to destruction without compensation or to remove (re-export) the material at the expense of the importer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Parliamentary Legal Advisers further indicated that the submission seemed to be premised on the view that the importer would be different from the buyer or the seller. Clause 43 seemed to be phrased to cater for all such eventualities and determined where the responsibility for compliance lay. DAFF was in agreement with these comments and indicated that the importer was mostly the seller, but may be different from the seller and buyer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Clause 44</em><br />\r\nThis clause concerned the export of plants and propagating material. DAFF agreed with the comments of the Parliamentary Legal Advisers that the same standards must be ensured for the products that the Republic sent out to other countries, so as to boost economic relations and also give the country a reputable status and international standing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Clause 47</em><br />\r\nThis clause spoke about the appeal against the decision of the Registrar or designated authority. The Parliamentary Legal Advisers commented that the prescriptions around the remuneration of the members of the Appeal Board could have consistency if the decisions were to be made after consultation with the Minister of Finance, in line with clause 47(2)(b). DAFF was in agreement with these comments but suggested an alternative wording on 47(2)(b):&nbsp; &ldquo;The remuneration of a member of the Board must be prescribed after consultation with the Minister of Finance&rdquo;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Parliamentary Legal Advisers had further commented that the role of the Minister during the Clause 47 appeals must be clear. The Parliamentary Legal Advisers had proposed that Clause 47 be redrafted. DAFF was in agreement with their proposed wording and suggested that it be adopted<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Clauses 48 and 49</em><br />\r\nThese clauses dealt with the Advisory Committee. The Parliamentary Legal Advisers had pointed out that the main point for consideration was in respect of clause 49(10), and had to do with whether the remuneration of the Advisory Committee members should not be prescribed after consultation with the Minister of Finance. DAFF agreed with the alternative wording on 49(10), &ldquo;The remuneration of a member of the Advisory Committee must be prescribed after consultation with the Minister of Finance&rdquo;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><em>Discussion</em></strong><br />\r\nMs A Steyn (DA) maintained that she still was not clear about the comment in relation to UPOV, but asked if the Bills would change substantially if South Africa were to decide to to with the UPOV 1991. On the issue of public participation, she wanted to establish if it was normal to be dealing with a matter after five or seven years, when things had really changed on the ground.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Julian Japhta, Chief Director: Plant Products and Health: DAFF, said that DAFF would take time to brief the Committee fully on the differences between the UPOV 1978 and 1991, and also would cover the importance of accession and issues of compliance. South Africa had not acceded formally to UPOV 1991.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Netnou-Nkoana reported that interaction with stakeholders had been continuous. In many cases, the DAFF had conducted workshops and held meetings on a one-on-one basis with different organisations. She said a list of communities and organisations with whom DAFF had been interacting could be sent to the Committee, and the Department would prepare a written account in relation to the question.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Julian Japhta added that in 2013 and 2015 consultations were done with farmers, and in 2014 the Department dealt with the Competition Commission.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr L Ntshayisa (AIC) asked if the varieties the Department was talking of were developed or under-developed plants. He further wanted to know if plant exportation did contribute to the economy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Netnou-Nkoana confirmed that the DAFF was referring to developed varieties, because they must be distinct, uniform, and stable. Speaking to the &nbsp;economic value of plant exports, she confirmed that the exportation of plants contributed enormously to the GDP and economy, and said that she would send statistics on this through to the Committee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Z Jongbloed (DA) enquired if South Africa had considered the international standards when the DAFF drafted the Bills, pointing out that South Africa was a signatory to many international agreements.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Japhta indicated that compliance had been observed, to make sure everything was in line with international standards and the Office of the Chief State Law Adviser dealt with the certification.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Jongbloed asked why the Bills had been aligned with UPOV 1991 when South Africa had not yet acceded to it<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Japhta explained that South Africa was a member of UPOV and had signed UPOV 1991 to indicate its intention to be bound, but there had not been formal accession to the agreement as yet. He commented that there seemed to be an impression that these two bills would offer South Africa the chance to join UPOV, whereas in fact South Africa had been with UPOV since 1978. The UPOV system ensured that farmers had access to varieties. UPOV 1991 restricted farmers on use of varieties, although these two bills would enhance and make it better for farmers to access new and better varieties.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Phumelele Ngema, Parliamentary Law Adviser, advised Members on the definition of &ldquo;sell&rdquo; in the Plant Breeders&rsquo; Rights Bill The definition that she had proposed was drawn from an acceptable legal definition used in the courts, and she had also considered the dictionary meaning, consulting and contrasting the use of both definitions. She said the Committee was at liberty to deliberate on this matter.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a name=\"__UnoMark__1199_1354365941\"></a>The meeting was adjourned.</p>\r\n",

        "summary": "<p>The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) took the Portfolio Committee through each clause on which the Parliamentary Legal Advisers had commented, both for the Plant Improvement Bill and Plant Breeders&rsquo; Rights Bills.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nComments had been made at the public submissions and the Parliamentary Legal Advisers had also made some suggestions. DAFF focused on clauses 10(2)(a), 11, 15, 19, 21, 52, 51(3) read with 52(1), and general comments. Requests were made for exclusions from clause 10, but DAFF agreed with the Parliamentary Legal Advisers that there did not appear to be any undue restrictions and all exceptions would be provided for in regulations. On clause 11, there was a suggestion that the clause should make it clear that an owner could charge per plant, plus a production royalty and fees, but DAFF clarified that the protection and limitation would not extend to varieties already in the market, to ensure that breeders would not collect royalties more than once, and that sales without consent of the breeder would not affect the right. Clause 15 dealt with varieties of recent creation. The Parliamentary Legal Advisers and DAFF were in agreement that this clause was in line with the UPOV international law. In regard to clause 19, dealing with rejection of applications, a suggestion had been made that section 11(g) and (i) of the 1976 Act should be retained, but DAFF clarified that this clause would provide for conditions that may lead to rejection of an application, and the Registrar would need to fully brief the applicant. Clause 21 dealt with amendment of an application, and DAFF, after considering the comment of the Parliamentary Legal Advisers, agreed that more clarity was needed, and would be redrafted to make it clear that if an amendment affected the description of the variety, the filing date would be the date on which the registrar accepted the amendment, which would have to be re-published. Clause 52 deal with offences and penalties, and DAFF clarified that its intention was to bring the fines into alignment with the Adjustment of Fines Act. It would be discussing with the Office of the Chief State Law Adviser whether there was a need to consult with the Minister of Justice. It was suggested that clauses 51(3) and 52(1) were flawed and in conflict with human and constitutional rights as well as intellectual property legislation, but DAFF and the Parliamentary Legal Advisers were satisfied that the Minister could set threshhold penalties. In relation to the criminalisation in clause 52, DAFF pointed out that it remained within the jurisdiction of the National Prosecuting Authority to decide whether to institute a prosecution, and created a statutory offence. The fears that further policing capacity would be required were unfounded. In relation to definitions, there had been suggestions on the word &ldquo;breeder&rdquo; and &ldquo;person&rdquo; but DAFF was satisfied that no amendments were needed. It did agree with the Parliamentary Legal Advisers&#39; suggestions on &ldquo;sell&rdquo;, to incorporate wording &ldquo;a disposal for some form of consideration&rdquo;. DAFF and the Parliamentary Legal Advisers agreed that there did not appear to be a need to replace clause 46(6), dealing with entering of premises, with the wording used in section 24A(6) of the current Act, as the search entry process set out was lawful and constitutional. Similarly, DAFF did not think there was a need to retain section 31 of the current Act for the purposes of ensuring food security or public interest, since this would be covered by the Expropriation Bill currently making its way through Parliament.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDAFF then briefed the Committee on the Plant Improvement Bill. DAFF was in agreement with the Parliamentary Legal Advisers on the evaluation of a plant for value, cultivation and use, but suggested that&nbsp; &ldquo;investigate&rdquo; in clauses 38(2) and 38(8) should be replaced with &ldquo;evaluate/evaluation&rdquo;. In relation to clause 43, concerns were expressed that destroying imported goods without compensation could amount to unfair deprivation, in the absence of a qualifier about harm to the Republic. DAFF pointed out that the clause did give the importer options to destroy without compensation or remove and re-import. DAFF also agreed with the Parliamentary Legal Advisers that the importer would not always, but may be different from buyer and seller. DAFF and the Parliamentary Legal Adviser agreed, in relation to clause 44, that it was important to ensure the same standards for products sent to other countries. Clause 47 dealt with appeals, and DAFF agreed with the Parliamentary Legal Advisers that greater consistency would be achieved on remuneration of the members of the Appeal Board if decisions were to be made after consultation with the Minister of Finance, but suggested a wording change. It would redraft the wording on the role of the Minister in line with the legal advisers&#39; suggestions. Again, in clauses 48 and 49, remuneration of members of the Advisory Committee would be prescribed after consultation with the Minister of Finance&rdquo;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMembers asked for clarity on the position of South Africa in relation to UPOV and why these Bills were drawn to be compliant with UPOV 1991 if South Africa had not yet acceded formally to that. They were interested in what consultation processes had been carried out, and the Department agreed to brief the Committee fully on the UPOV and to send a list of interactions. Members asked if the DAFF was referring to developed or undeveloped plants, and if plant exports contributed to the economy, and asked for assurance that the Bills were compliant with international standards and obligations.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "body": "<p><em><strong>Plant Breeders&rsquo; Rights Bill </strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Phumelele Ngema, Parliamentary Legal Advisor, briefed the Members about issues that had arisen from the public hearings and the response the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) had given to the processing of the Plant Breeders&rsquo; Rights and Plant Improvement Bills before the Committee, and touched on proposed clauses that required a new look for drafting purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With regard to the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV), she said that Section 231 (5) of the Constitution explained the status of the 1978 UPOV and its binding effect. The DAFF had informed the Committee that only the 1978 UPOV had been ratified and it was the only one that was binding, and not UPOV 1991. However, it should be kept in mind that the 1991 UPOV was the revised version of the 1978 one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Committee heard that both these conventions related to plant breeding and plant varieties, and that was why the relevant Bill linked to them was called the Plant Breeders&rsquo; Rights Bill. This Bill had, for example, adopted word for word all the definitions of the UPOV 1991. In the light of this, there was no need to argue either for the &rsquo;78 or &rsquo;91 UPOV incorporation, as other objectors had done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clause 10 (2) (a), when read with UPOV &rsquo;91, made provisions for the Minister to prescribe regulations on categories of farmers that may use protected varieties. Looking at articles 14 to 17 of the UPOV &rsquo;91, she saw no restriction or problem created by clause 10 (2) (a). In fact, the Bill defined &ldquo;protected variety&rdquo; as a variety in respect of which a plant breeder&rsquo;s right had been granted, and that definition was aligned with the purpose of the Convention as well as the intention of the Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Article 5 of the &rsquo;91 UPOV stipulated that the breeder&rsquo;s right should be granted where the variety was new, distinct, uniform, and stable. The protected variety was that which met the criteria set out in article 5 and the definition in the Bill. UPOV &rsquo;78 provided in article 2 (2) that each member state may limit the application of this Convention within a genus or species to varieties with a particular manner of reproduction or multiplication or certain end-use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Articles 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13 and 14 of the &rsquo;78 UPOV addressed the protection and rights for breeders with protected varieties. These provisions were also not in contradiction with clause 10 (2) (a). Clause 11 dealt with the exhaustion of plant breeders&rsquo; rights. Objectors had indicated this was a restriction to the breeder&rsquo;s right and confined the extent of the protection of the breeder&rsquo;s right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The protection and limitation in Clause 11 did not extend to the breeds that were already in the market. It also excluded the breeder&rsquo;s rights for varieties mentioned in Clause 7 (3) and those which were already in the market at the commencement of this Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Article 6 (2) of UPOV &rsquo;91 had paraphrased what had been covered in UPOV &rsquo;78 article 6, when it was read together with articles 12 and 13. What article 6 (2) of UPOV &rsquo;91 did was to bring clarity in draft form and opted for simple English that was precise. The Bill complied fully with the obligations conferred and expected of member states, as depicted in article 30 of UPOV &rsquo;78, as well as the concern raised in respect of Clause 13 of the Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clauses 19 and 21 dealt with how the application of a breeder&rsquo;s right was rejected. The response from DAFF in respect of the Clause 21 objection did not provide clarity, in that they had not offered a way forward, and this was a technical and policy concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clauses 51 (3) and 52 (1) (b) empowered the Minister to determine administrative penalties for contravening the regulations, and set limits for such penalties. Such a provision may be intended to create consistency and guide the courts when deciding sentences on these matters, while the courts were inherently empowered to consider each peculiarity and circumstance of each case upon conviction. Both these clauses were empowering provisions stemming from the main legislation, and that was what the law required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clauses 52 (1) (b) and 52 (1) (a) created a statutory offence. However, the offence required no further policing capacity as suggested by the submission. Instead, the contravention would easily be detected through appropriate administrative functions of the Registrar or DAFF systems, and would be taken through the prosecuting processes where necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clause 46 (6) and Section 24a (6) enabled entry into premises without a warrant, but with consent of the owner or authorised person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr T Ramokhoase (ANC) indicated that the presentation had made it clear that Members should not be bothered about UPOV 1978/1991. It could be concluded that UPOV 91 was the upgrade of UPOV 78.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Tembile Songabe, Director of Veterinary Public Health: DAFF, further informed the Committee that the DAFF had taken a strong stand over the destruction of imported good without compensation. It was an offence to import goods without following import procedures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Plant Improvement Bill </strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Ngema pointed out that Clause 38 of the Bill, on variety value, cultivation and use (VCU), did not contend with the view of the objectors. What the Clause sought to do was to enable the Registrar -- when there was doubt and for the benefit of the public -- to intervene and make an evaluation that determined properly what the value of that variety should be. This was because the Registrar possessed the expertise and knowledge that could be used comparatively to reach a fair value and know if the variety was harmful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clause 43 dealt with import rules in respect of plants brought into the country and the consequences for failure to comply. However, there was a concern over the destruction of the imported goods without compensation, as this amounted to unfair deprivation and there was no qualifier as to whether such material would be harmful to the Republic or have any other repercussions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The submission seemed to be premised on the view that the importer would be different from that of the buyer or seller. Clause 43, in the manner it was phrased, seemed to cater for all such eventualities, and determined with whom the final responsibility of compliance lay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clause 44 dealt with exports. It stated that if the Republic expected quality imported products, the same standards should be applied to products that the Republic exported. This would not only boost economic relations, but would also give the country a reputable status and international standing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She also pointed out that in Clause 49 (10), there was a point that needed to be considered. This was around whether the remuneration of the Advisory Committee members should not be prescribed after consultation with the Minister of Finance. Clause 47 (2) (b) stated that the prescription of the remuneration of the members of the Appeal Board could have consistence if made after consultation with the Finance Minister.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The role played by the Minister during Clause 47 appeals must be clear. For instance, it was stated that the aggrieved person filed the appeal with the Minister, but the Minister did not make any decision on the appeal. The Board made the decision, and the Minister did not even get to be informed of the decision of the Board. It was also not clear to whom the Board was reporting. The Minister became a kind of a post box. She suggested that Clause 47 should be re-drafted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Performing Animal Protection Amendment (PAPA) Bill</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adv Yoland&eacute; van <em>Aswegen,</em> Office of the Chief State Law Adviser, took the Members through the proposed Performing Animal Protection Amendment (PAPA) Bill working document, page by page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Page 3</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson, on 3D, wanted to know why it was not the Minister that appointed the experts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Ngema responded that it was the duty of the Director-General to appoint officials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Page 4</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms A Steyn (DA), on 3F2(d), suggested the line to be rephrased, and the word &lsquo;equipment&rsquo; be inserted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adv Van Aswegen, on 3F2(d), suggested that &lsquo;living quarters&rsquo; be replaced with &lsquo;accommodation&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Songabe, on 3F2(d), proposed the insertion of &lsquo;when performing and not performing&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson, on 3F2(c), proposed for the insertion of &lsquo;full&rsquo; before &lsquo;description&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr N Paulsen (EFF) suggested the Bill should be prescriptive and state clearly the type of animal that was going to be used for safeguarding and exhibition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson said it was not only dogs that were used for safeguarding. There were also other animals that were used for exhibition. That was why the Committee had decided to use the word &lsquo;animal&rsquo; and not be specific. The Chairperson further noted that Members should be aware that the Act was going to be read with the Protection Animal Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn, on 3F2(d), said there was nothing that spoke about the issue of travelling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson referred Members to Section 10 (c) and (d) of the Regulations. She said the things that Members wanted could be included in the Regulations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Ramokhoase suggested the Committee should proceed to the next item, because the Chairperson had explained everything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn proposed that the age of the animal that was going to be used for exhibition or safeguarding should be stated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Songabe explained that the issue Ms Steyn was raising was contained in the Bill 3F2(a).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn wanted to know which Act covered the methods of training for safeguarding and exhibition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Songabe stated that the Animal Protection Act covered that aspect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn proposed that information on whether the applicant had ever held, or had been previously refused a licence, should be stated in the Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Ramokhoase said that that information would be covered and verified when one made an application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Ngema reported that this was already covered in Section 3H (a), (b) and 3I.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Department agreed that the suggestion of Ms Steyn should be inserted as (i) in 3F2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn, on Subsection 3, suggested that &lsquo;may&rsquo; be changed to &lsquo;must&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson indicated that that was not possible, because the legal practitioners had explained to the Committee about the use of &lsquo;may&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn then suggested that 3G should fall under 3J</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Department agreed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Page 6</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn proposed that 3L should come before &lsquo;Suspension, withdrawal or amendment of licence&rsquo; on Page.5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Department agreed to place 3L after &lsquo;Duration of licence&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr R Cebekhulu (IFP), on 3N (4), wanted to know who prescribed the remuneration of Board members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Ngema said it was the Minister who prescribed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professor Edith Vries, Director-General: DAFF, indicated that the process followed Treasury guidelines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Page 7</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn, on 3P, regarding the consideration of appeal by the Minister, remarked that there was too much power on the hands of the Minister in terms of the final decision, because it was indicated in the original Bill that it should be the Appeal Board that had the final say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson explained that the Minister was responsible for the implementation of the Act. The Board was helping the Minister with the appeals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn wanted to know how many days the Minister could take to hear the appeals. There were no timeframes stated in the Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A legal advisor from the DAFF said that the Minister must do so within a reasonable time, and this meant 90 to 100 days. This could be further extended if there was a need. This information was going to be contained in the Regulations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Page 8</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn, on Section 5, regarding the &lsquo;obstruction of the police officer&rsquo;, proposed the provision of &lsquo;both&rsquo; on penalties and sentencing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Ngema said that was not a problem. Provision would be made for the magistrate to use discretionary powers regarding this, and this would be included in the final draft of the Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr C Maxegwana (ANC), on Regulation (c), asked for clarity on &lsquo;animal class&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Songabe said &lsquo;animal class&rsquo; referred to &lsquo;breed&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Page 10</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson, on Section 11 (b), regarding the definition of &lsquo;an animal scientist&rsquo;, asked for clarity on the use of both &lsquo;professional&rsquo; and &lsquo;certificated&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Nokuzola Mgxashe, Committee Researcher, said that this provided for the different categories of qualifications &ndash; those with a professional practice number and those who had a diploma or a BTech. That was why both words were used. Under &lsquo;Certificated&rsquo; there were two levels. Level A comprised those with a diploma, plus one to three years&rsquo; experience. Level B consisted of those who did not have a three-year diploma and the necessary experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Songabe added that the consideration was based on the expertise the practitioners possessed. Those who had diplomas did qualify to carry out the duties of an Animal Welfare Scientist, but Animal Welfare Assistants did not necessarily have to have a diploma.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson suggested that &lsquo;certificated&rsquo; be removed and &lsquo;professional&rsquo; be retained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Adoption of Minutes</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Committee adopted two sets of minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson took Members through the minutes of 4 August 2015, page by page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Ramokhoase moved their adoption and Mr S Mncwabe (NFP) seconded him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson took Members through the minutes of 11 August 2015, page by page. Ms T Tongwane (ANC) moved their adoption. Ms Steyn and Mr Paulsen seconded her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The meeting was adjourned.</p>\r\n",

The Committee also gave consideration to the Performing Animals Protection Amendment (PAPA) Bill, and proposed several amendments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the Plant Improvement Bill, it was stated that Clause 47 made the Minister appear like a &ldquo;post box.&rdquo; The role of the Minister during the appeals process was not clearly defined.

        "body": "<p><strong>Quarter 4 2014/15 Performance Report</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professor Edith Vries, Director-General: DAFF, focused her presentation on Programmes Administration; Agricultural Production, Health and Food Safety; Food Security and Agrarian Reform; Trade Promotion and Market Access; Forestry and Natural Resources Management; and Fisheries Management<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Programme 1: Administration</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding efficient and effective internal control and strengthening the culture of compliance, the Risk Management Plan has been developed, approved and implemented by the Risk Management Committee. The Director-General and Minister in the beginning of Quarter 2 have approved the Human Resources Plan. The Department continued to monitor and evaluate the Human Resources Plan through its implementation plan. The Integrated Development Finance Policy Framework was developed and approved by EXCO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On strengthening institutional mechanisms for integrated policy and planning, all the publications were updated accordingly and the information was loaded on the website for all to access. The data updated on Fisheries is only based on Aquaculture, as it is the only usable statistics found. The strategic plan and the Annual Performance Plan were tabled in Parliament on 11 March 2015. The Research and Development Agenda was updated and approved for implementation in guiding the call for projects under the RTF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Programme 2: Agricultural Production, Health and Food Safety</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With regard to advancing APAP through increased production and productivity in prioritised value chain, and on effective management of bio-security and sector related risks, a report on the 2 animal improved scheme monitored was compiled with the purpose of measuring the impact of the scheme on animal production for prioritised value chain commodities. A report on the delivery of Primary Animal Health Care mobile clinics was compiled and delivered to provinces. The Animal Disease Management Plan was developed to improve the performance of Veterinary Services with the mission to ensure that human and animal well-being is optimised. The Surveillance Report on 1 plant disease and pest risk was compiled. The purpose of the surveillance is to detect, prevent and mitigate the outbreak of plant diseases and pests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Programme 3: Food Security and Agrarian Reform</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Concerning leading and coordinating government food security initiatives, the Food and Nutrition Security Implementation Plan has been finalised. The target was not achieved on the 2 452 smallholder producers that were supposed to have been supported through CASP because the non-alignment of the technical indicator descriptions for PDAs and DAFF rendered some unacceptable evidence during auditing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The target was not achieved on the 3 262.1 ha planted in the North West because the HODs have not signed off on their planting reports. DAFF engaged with the HODs to take corrective action. On enhancing skills capacity for efficient delivery and strengthening planning, implementation and monitoring of programmes, the norms and standards on comprehensive producer support were endorsed by EXCO on 16 March 2015. The Reviewed National Education and Training Strategy was tabled at the EXCO meeting on March 2015 and was approved. Provincial Extension Forums were established in all provinces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Programme 4: Economic Development, Trade and Marketing</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pertaining to ensuring support for market access and processing of agricultural products, 39 producers were linked to markets during Quarter 4. The certification programme has been up-scaled through the South African Good Agricultural Practices (SA-GAP) and this has led to higher achievements. In collaboration with the Forestry Sector Charter Council, the annual report on status of transformation in the forestry sector has been completed and approved by the Council. Progress reports on implementation and negotiations of trade agreements have been consolidated. The signing of CAADP compact by the business community and government could not be presented to the Cabinet for approval because it has to be recommended by the Cluster committees. The recommendation by these Cluster committees could not be secured during the year under review.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Programme 5: Forestry and Natural Resources Management</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to ensure the conservation, protection, rehabilitation and recovery of depleted and degraded natural resources, 189.41 ha of woodlands and indigenous forests were rehabilitated. 18657.9 ha of land were rehabilitated. The over achievement of 9157.9 ha was due to additional funding on Land Care fencing projects from CASP which led to more additional hectares being rehabilitated in the Western Cape. Climate change research programmes on crop suitability has been implemented in Limpopo, Free State, and Mpumalanga provinces, and a detailed report on implementation has been compiled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Programme 6: Fisheries Management</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three fish farms were supported. Technical Assessments and Site Visits were conducted. Financial support was provided through the Aquaculture Development and Enhancement programme. Internal consultations on the Aquaculture Bill were conducted and the Concept Bill was approved by EXCO on 30 March 2015. 2011 sea based and land based inspections and investigations of right holders in the 4 prioritised fisheries were conducted.&nbsp; Hake TAC recommendations were formulated and approved. Growth trials on dusky kob were performed following the development of a dietary formula and that boosted growth of 5g juveniles to 53g size within 10 weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>(Graphs and tables were shown to illustrate budget expenditure)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Quarter 1 2015/16 Performance Report</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Director-General focused her presentation on Programmes Administration; Agricultural Production, Health and Food Safety; Food Security and Agrarian Reform; Trade Promotion and Market Access; Forestry and Natural Resources Management; and Fisheries Management<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Programme 1: Administration</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With regard to ensuring compliance with statutory requirements and good governance practices, and on strengthening institutional mechanisms for integrated policy, planning, monitoring and evaluation, the Project Risk Assessment was conducted during the period under review. The Human Resources Plan Implementation Report has been developed and submitted on 27 May 2015 at DPSA. The MTEF HR Plan has been developed, approved and submitted to DPSA on 30 June 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eight new misconduct cases were received and only 1 has been finalised. The other 7 cases are at various stages towards completion and are still within 100 days standard. The Plant Health and Liquor Bills were en route to the Minister. The quarterly report on Implementation of Integrated Development Finance Framework has been submitted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The environmental scan was conducted as desktop research. The scan focused on the technical content to address new priorities and to ensure alignment with new priorities. The documents analysed included APAP, MTSF, Revitalisation of Agriculture, Food Security and Nutrition Implementation Plan and Aquaculture Operation Phakisa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seven Service Level Agreements with ARC could not be signed due to the delay of ARC Legal Services which is considering some recommendations. The Policy Analysis and Review Tool was reviewed and updated to include criteria for selecting sectoral policies for review, the roles and responsibilities of policy owners and for the PPME branch and the processes to validate the outcome from the review.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Media plans have been compiled and implemented. Provincial IGR forums have not been established. However, DAFF is supporting DRDLR with establishing District Land Committees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Programme 2: Agricultural Production, Health and Food Safety</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On effective management of bio-security and ensuring increased production and productivity in prioritised areas, the Procurement Plan was developed and sent through to supply chain for implementation during 2015/16. The draft Veterinary Strategy has been developed. A submission to the Minister to request permission to consult stakeholders on the draft Veterinary Strategy was drafted but not yet approved. The consultation processes would commence immediately once permission has been granted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The survey and analysis of the current situation has been conducted. This has resulted in an inventory of the status of Farm Animal Genetic Resources. The provinces have been informed of the project. The monitoring of the seed scheme has been done and data captured for 27 units that were registered during the quarter. Four regulatory interventions were implemented involving the quarantine of animals, inspections at regional and port of entries, surveillance and testing. A report on the monitoring interventions was completed for the quarter under review.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Programme 3: Food Security and Agrarian Reform</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The production plan for 2015/16 has been developed. Targets were not met for the 662 household that were supposed to be supported through the food and nutritional security initiatives because the process of validating evidence is progressing and the report results would be reflected in the next quarterly report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>718 smallholder producers were not supported because of delays in the transfer of CASP funds to the provinces. The target for the 1st draft of Comprehensive Producer Development Support Policy was not achieved because a roadmap for fast-tracking the conclusion of the Policy has not been tabled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The draft terms of reference for National Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Education and Training implementation forum has been developed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Programme 4: Economic Development, Trade</em> <em>and Marketing</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pertaining to ensuring support for market access and processing of agricultural products, the Good Agriculture Practices (GAP) pre-audits have been concluded for 6 farms under the South Africa-Good Agriculture Practices (SA-GAP).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was no sitting of the Aquaculture Value Chain Round-table during the quarter under review because the industry is still aligning the work of the AVCRT with Operation Phakisa for Aquaculture. Ten cooperatives were supported with training using the Farm Together cooperative training programme (5 in Limpopo and 5 in KwaZulu-Natal).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DAFF participated in a Strategic Planning session of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) &ndash; RSA Capacity Building project on 5 and 6 May 2015; and also participated in the Agro Dealer Project Inception Workshop in Polokwane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consultations with the NEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency were arranged for June to draft the terms of reference for analytical studies. The draft Terms of Reference for analytical studies for evidenced based planning is available. The Cabinet memo on CAADP Compact has been revised and is ready for resubmission to Director-General Clusters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Programme 5: Forestry and Natural Resources Management</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The implementation plan for the biogas production integrated crop-livestock system was developed. The Ministerial consented to the gazetting of the promulgation of the Preservation and Development of Agricultural Land Framework Bill. The notice for public comments was gazetted on 13 March 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The environmental practitioner was appointed and an inception report was submitted. The appointment of the Professional Service Provider was done in February 2015. DAFF took into consideration unforeseen delays such as the tender being advertised repeatedly before the suitable candidate could be appointed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Programme 6: Fisheries Management</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phase 1 of Operation Phakisa has been supported through the Aquaculture Development and Enhancement Programme (ADEP). The target for finalising the Draft Aquaculture Bill was not achieved though input from stakeholders has been consolidated and discussed. The DPME informed DAFF that the Socio Economic Impact Assessment Systems (SEISAS) should be incorporated in all policies and legislation being developed with effect from 1 July 2015. So, the undertaking of the SEISAS in the drafting of the Aquaculture Bill delayed the finalisation of the drafted Bill. 1524 compliance and enforcement measures in the four prioritised fisheries sector &ndash; hake, abalone, rock lobster, and line fish &ndash; have been implemented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>(Graphs and tables were shown to illustrate budget expenditure)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr C Maxegwana (ANC) remarked there is disjuncture when it comes to the performance of the Office of the Director-General when it is compared with other areas of the Department. He asked for clarity on budget-cuts, and wanted to establish how the Department is going to succeed in agro-processing if there are no Provincial IGR Forums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Director-General, regarding the disjuncture in her Office, said her Office is a governance area. It needs to be judged on indicators. The Office looks at risk management and overall performance of the Department. On the issue of budget-cuts, the Department is doing more with less. For instance, the 7% increase for civil servants was not budgeted for and it is going to be taken from goods and services. Things are going to be tighter and tighter. Concerning agro-processing, 25% of manufacturing is agro-processing. The agro-processing plan is ready to be presented to the Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr T Ramokhoase (ANC) asked why the target on the Aquaculture Bill was not met.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Siphokazi Ndudane, Acting Director-General in Fisheries Management: DAFF, explained that the Bill has been developed but the requirement for social impact came very late. Two workshops ere conducted to assist with the incorporation of social impact in the Bill. This is going to fall under 2015/16 Quarter 2 Performance Report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Z Mandela (ANC) asked the Department to explain misconduct regarding the disciplinary cases, and the nature of the cases. How were targets going to be met if there is no set budget for irrigation schemes?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Director-General, on the meaning of misconduct, explained that the moment a person is charged, the act starts to count that as misconduct. This excludes the investigation period. The nature of the cases could not be discussed on a public forum. Most cases are around the misuse of government vehicles, AWOL, fraud, and financial and procurement mismanagement. Concerning the irrigation schemes budget, she acknowledged that no budget was given to the irrigation schemes, but agricultural engineers are going to develop on-farm plans. The budget is with the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform, and in order to implement irrigation there must first be an increase in the amount of land under production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Z Jongbloed (DA) wanted to know why the target on the bona fide fisheries report was not met and asked for clarity on the racial quotas. She asked if the Department would be carrying out the verification process or if it is going to be outsourced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Siphokazi Ndudane, with regard to bona fide fisheries, indicated that bona fide fisheries could not be appointed because comments were not yet finalised. The period for comments has been extended. On racial quotas, there were people deliberately confusing people on racial quotas. In the legislation that deals with racial quotas there is a paragraph that talks about balancing a criteria. It is stated that rights could not be allocated to all those who qualify. Criteria for scoring those who qualify have to be used.&nbsp; The document also talks about the use of demographics. It says they <em>may be used</em> whether they are national, provincial or even those of the metro cities. That is not a racial thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pertaining to verification, the Department would not be involved in the verification process. Verification is going to be outsourced according to provinces. It is going to benefit all those who have applied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr N Paulsen (EFF) enquired what the Department is doing to make sure local retailers buy from local smallholder farmers, and if there were incentives in place to ensure that the country trades with neighbouring African countries instead of Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Minister said it is important to look at the quality of the product to ensure it meets the standards of the retailers or buyers. This also requires the improvement of entrepreneurial skills. Local retailers do buy from small stakeholder farmers. It takes time to know what the buyers want in terms of quality specifications. Fortunately, that information has been collected and is being shared with smallholder farmers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Director-General, concerning trading incentives, indicated that the provision of incentives is not the mandate of the Department.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr S Mncwabe (NFP) asked whether funding was provided to the ten cooperatives that were supported in Limpopo and KwaZulu-Natal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An official of the Department acknowledged that funding has been stretched across the role players. Key players interact with the Department of Trade and Industry for the registration of co-operatives. DAFF only provides training; the provinces are responsible for implementation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms A Steyn (DA) asked if the Department is budgeting according to trends and what the impact is of not working on 25/25. There is a need to set the baseline to make sure there is an impact because the target of supporting 662 households through food and nutritional security initiatives was not met.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Jacob Hlatshwayo, Chief Financial Officer: DAFF, with regard to budget, indicated that the Department is making use of simple mathematics which involves taking the total budget and divide it by twelve on a monthly basis. On baseline, the Department approached Treasury to look at the augmentation for funds requested in the past years. The Department has spoken to Statistics SA for the establishment of the baseline and to have it monitored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson asked for clarity on the Food Security Plan; and why it is difficult to get information from provincial HODs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Mortimer Mannya, Deputy Director-General in Agricultural Production, Health and Food Safety: DAFF, said verification has been done. The HODs requested an extension of time so that they could do their own verification because they had to sign the reports. Concerning the Food Security Plan, DAFF has submitted a plan and an evaluation report. Cabinet indicated it should be submitted as a Food and Nutrition Security Implementation Plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr N Cebekhulu (IFP) asked how long South Africa is going to rely on GMOs to feed herself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An official from the Department explained that discussions were held with Parliament to provide space for the utilisation of GMOs for preserving animal health. It is only maize, Soya and cotton that contain GM. The issue around the GMO is legislated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The meeting was adjourned.</p>\r\n",

Three Bills (Plant Breeders&rsquo; Right Bill; Plant Improvement Bill; and the Performing Animals Protection Amendment Bill) were approved by Cabinet and are being discussed by Parliament.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIntra-African trade increased by 44,8% during the past financial year. The main products that drove the increase were fruits such as apples, fresh grapes and pears while wine, sugar, maize and fish remain the major contributors to exports.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe up scaling of the certification programme through the South African Good Agricultural Practices (SA-GAP) led to higher achievement. 39 producers who are in the process of being SA-GAP certified were linked to markets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe largest sub-sector in the agriculture, forestry and fisheries export basket in 2014, based on value, were fruit and nuts while the highest growth was in the export of wood with a growth rate of 72%. The Draft Aquaculture Bill is being consulted and is expected to be ready by 2016/17.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn lowlights, reliable timeous reporting by provinces and effective monitoring remained imperfect. The Public Entities Governance and Reporting Framework was not approved. The Department was unable to meet the deadline for the gazetting of the Regulations for Small-Scale Fishing as the period for consultation was extended.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Department spent 18, 9% of its budget. For all the quarters; it spent 99.1% of the total budget of R6, 6 billion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRegarding the 2015/16 first quarter performance report, DAFF pointed Phase 1 of Operation Phakisa was supported through the Aquaculture Development and Enhancement Programme (ADEP).

        "body": "<p><strong>PAPA Presentation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Advocate Barry Beukes, Deputy Director in the Legal Administration Office: DAFF, took the Committee through the amendments and insertions contained in the Performing Animals Protection Amendment Bill (PAPA).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clause 4, Section 4 substituted &ldquo;dogs&rdquo; for &ldquo;animals&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clause 5, Section 5 changed &ldquo;shall be&rdquo; to &ldquo;is&rdquo;. R4 000 is changed to R20 000. Twelve months is substituted for five years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clause 6, on (c) and (d) &ldquo;certificate&rdquo; is changed to &ldquo;license&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Section 7 sees the insertion of (b) which deals with the changing of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to &ldquo;must&rdquo;, insertion of &ldquo;or dogs&rdquo;, and changing of &ldquo;certificates&rdquo; to &ldquo;licenses&rdquo; and (c) which deals with the substitution of &ldquo;certificates&rdquo; by &ldquo;licenses&rdquo;. Then (e) deals with consequential amendment. R4 000 is changed to R20 000, and twelve months is changed to five years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clause 8, Section 11 &ndash; no changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clause 9 &ndash; a new clause has been inserted before the law is enacted. This is subsection 2 and 3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clause 10 deals with changing &ldquo;dog&rdquo; to &ldquo;an animal for safeguarding&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clause 11 deals with the title of the Act. It is called the Performing Animals Protection Amendment Act, 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Update on the Performing Animals Protection Amendment Bill [B9-2015]</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Thembile Songabe, Director in Veterinary Public Health: DAFF, informed the Committee that during the processing of the Bill, and after the public hearings, it became apparent that consequential amendments of certain Sections of the principal Act were required to be added to those initially proposed by the Executive. These additional consequential amendments included Sections 4, 5 and 7 of the Principal Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 5 June 2015, the Portfolio Committee on Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries deliberated on the consequences and the implications for the deadline of 12 July 2015. A resolution was taken by the Committee to approach the Concourt to request an extension of 12 months from the current deadline of 12 July 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DAFF filed an urgent application to the Concourt for the extension. The basis of the affidavit filed by DAFF centred around the fact that the additional amendments require the Committee, according to Rule NA249 (3b), to obtain permission from National Assembly to amend other provisions or existing legislation other than those which the Executive had initially sought to amend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The time frame with regard to these amendments is dependant upon whether the report is placed on the order paper and deliberated by the National Assembly and the date that a resolution is taken by National Assembly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Council of Provinces (NCOP) must also process the Bill in terms of Section 75 of the Constitution and the relevant NCOP Rules. On 10 July 2015 the Concourt concluded that the Minister would grant a short extension pending a determination of the request. In this regard, the order made on 27 November 2014 has been varied by further extending the suspension of the declaration of constitutional invalidity of the impugned sections in the case of NSPCA v/s DAFF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Concourt granted a short extension to 28 August 2015 instead of the 12 months requested in the founding affidavit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The view of the Concourt was that it is in the interests of justice that a written submission of not more than 20 pages be written by both parties. An order was issued as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The NSPCA was directed to file an opposing affidavit, if it so wishes, on or before 17 July 2015</li>\r\n\t<li>The Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries must file a responding written argument on or before 24 July 2015</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The Concourt ordered that the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA) to further file a responding affidavit by 31 July 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 13 July 2013 the Department received communication from the NSPCA that the party would not be filing Heads of Argument in the matter, but would be leaving the matter in the hands of the court. By implication this means DAFF would also not be filing any responding affidavits. This then leaves the decision to the Concourt regarding the extension. In view of the above, DAFF would now wait for further feedback from the Concourt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Response by DAFF to Public Hearing Comments</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Noluthando Netnou-Nkoana, Director in Genetic Resources, DAFF took the Committee through the responses clause by clause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&lsquo;Convention Country&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The definition of &ldquo;Convention Country&rdquo; should be amended to &ldquo;Agreement Country&rdquo; to recognise Zimbabwe (which is not yet a member of UPOV) and the agreement of South Africa in terms of PBRs with this country. &lsquo;Convention Country&rsquo; is only for those countries that are also members for specific UPOV matters e.g. recognition of priority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DAFF is not aware of agreement between Zimbabwe and South Africa on PBR (Plant Breeders&rsquo; Rights).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other clauses include, &lsquo;any other country&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clause 6: Right to apply for PBR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not clear who is entitled to apply for a PBR. It is addressed in 16(1) and should be read with the definitions of applicant and breeder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clause 7: Protection given to holder of plant breeder&rsquo;s rights</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Section 7(3)(b)(i) it is suggested to add, a variety, which includes a sport or mutation that must be regarded as essentially derived variety (EDV). Inclusion of examples may exclude EDVs (Essentially Derived Varieties) obtained in other ways. The UPOV Council has adopted Explanatory Notes on Essentially Derived Varieties to guide member countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Clause 8 (2): Duration of plant</em> <em>breeder&rsquo;s right</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The kind of crops per period should be specified. Currently, this is vague and leaves room for periods being altered at any stage. Section 8(2) states that these would be prescribed in the Regulations. The reason to keep this in the Regulations was to be able to alter as per industry needs e.g. industry requested potatoes and fruit trees to carry 30 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Clause 9: Period of Sole Right</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It does not specify who would prescribe how long the sole right would be. The Minister prescribes the Regulations but these Regulations are consulted with stakeholders before they are submitted to the Minister.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clause 10: Exceptions to plant breeder&rsquo;s right</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is requested that fruit and flowers be specifically excluded. It is envisaged that all exceptions would be covered in the Regulations (after extensive consultations with all stakeholders). The Minister is empowered to decide on a royalty that may be different to that charged by the owner. The intention is for the Minister to prescribe conditions for payment of royalties and not the amounts. The Minister must be clear about definitions held within the Bill that speak to smallholder farmers and be clear in allowing farmers to save and exchange seed. The Bill must give specific guidelines on this provision and include a clause that states that no contract or other agreement can annul these exceptions. The law is skewed too much in favour of the breeder. Categories of farmers, crops, and uses would be defined in the Regulations (after extensive consultations with all stakeholders). Section 10(2)(a) is not keeping with UPOV 1991 Act. South Africa is not bound by UPOV 1991. Exceptions attempt to cater for South African circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clause 11: Exhaustion of plant breeder&rsquo;s right</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This</p>\r\n\r\n<p>clause should make it clear that legislators do not wish to exclude an owner from charging per plant plus a production royalty and other fees as appropriate. This is relevant in relation to the notion of &ldquo;sold or otherwise marketed by the breeder or with his consent&rdquo;. The right is not exhausted when the material of the variety has been sold or otherwise marketed without the breeder&rsquo;s consent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Clause </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>13: Transfer of a plant breeders&rsquo; right</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Licensees should be given a notice of assignment. The onus of informing the Registrar of an assignment should rather be on the assignee. Section 13 should include a clause stating &ldquo;unless an assignment is recorded, it shall not be valid, except as between the parties thereto&rdquo;. Section 13(2) does not contain a provision similar to provision 29(1)(b) of the 1976 Act, to the effect that it must be proved that the notice of the transfer of a PBR has been served on every person licensed in respect of the PBR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The onus of informing a licensee is with the PBR holder. Licence: private contract between breeder and licensee. The Registrar is not in a position to &lsquo;police&rsquo;. The Registrar mainly deals with PBR holder. A Provision is made for compulsory licences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Clause </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>15: Varieties in respect of which plant breeders&rsquo; rights may be granted (varieties of recent creation)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UPOV Act of 1991 Art 6(2) provides for novelty in regard to varieties of recent creation, which should also be included in the Bill. i.e. in the case of a plant genus or species which was not previously included for protection by the PBR Act. The novelty requirement would be satisfied even where the sale or disposal to others took place earlier than the time limits defined in 15(2)(a).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This Bill offers protection in respect of any variety of all plant genera and species.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clause 16: Application for grant of a plant breeder&rsquo;s right</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The clause</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;application being returned to the applicant&rdquo; is unclear, and should be replaced with &ldquo;application being rejected&rdquo;. It is not rejected, as in clause 19, per se. The application is returned to the applicant not to clog the system. It is up to the applicant to re-submit the application once all outstanding documents become available, as long as such application still complies with the requirements of the Act, e.g. novelty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clause 18: Provisional protection</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Provisional protection has weakened compared to the 2013 draft. Vegetatively and asexually propagated species should also feature under provisional protection</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Section 18(2) was inserted to clarify that infringement proceedings may be instituted only after a plant breeder&rsquo;s right has been granted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Clause </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>19: Rejection of an application</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sections 11 (g) and (i) of 1976 Act have been omitted. These sections should be retained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They are not included because these sections deal with matters the Registrar cannot verify before tests and trials are concluded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term &ldquo;misrepresentation&rdquo; is too onerous. It is not fair for a breeder to lose rights in the situation where he/she was not aware that an incorrect representation had been made or where the incorrect representation is not material. It should be amended to: &ldquo;a material misrepresentation that the applicant was aware of at the time of filing the application&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It would be impossible for the Registrar to determine that the applicant was not aware of the misrepresentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this stage there are no breeders&rsquo; rights to lose as it is at an application stage. If the Registrar rejects due to misrepresentation, an applicant would be informed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Clause 21: Amendment of application</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The requirement that the description of the variety may not be amended is too onerous. A provision should be made for the correction of obvious errors. If an amendment of an application affects the description of the variety, it creates uncertainty around the true identity of the variety concerned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Clause </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>24: Amendment of denomination</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are situations where it is necessary to amend a denomination after grant. Section 24(3) should refer to &ldquo;before or after the grant&rdquo;. Provision is made for amendment of denomination by Registrar in Section 24(1). Section 24(3) refers to when the applicant requests an amendment. This must be only before the grant as the denomination is the unique identity for the variety concerned. Currently, applicants change denominations up to three times after the grant of a plant breeder&rsquo;s right, thereby confusing farmers and consumers regarding the identity of such a variety. Also, the Department is not aware of any other PBR law that allows for a change of denomination after a PBR has been granted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clause 26: Examination</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Section</p>\r\n\r\n<p>26 (2) should be amended to provide that it is possible to obtain further extensions of time &lsquo;on good cause shown&rsquo; as on a number of occasions plant material has died in quarantine due to no fault of the applicant</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This clause was discussed extensively during public consultations. It was agreed that initial periods would be realistic enough to cater for instances where material dies in quarantine and, therefore, instead of the current 12 months initial periods, it can be, for example, 5 years and extended for another 5 years. The aim is to address the current practice where, in some instances, plant material is submitted 15 years after the application was lodged. Also, &lsquo;on good cause shown&rsquo; is open to different interpretations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>28: Grant of plant breeder&rsquo;s right</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Section 27 should mention that the Registrar must publish the grant of an application. Section 27 deals with refusal to grant a plant breeder&rsquo;s right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All publications would be dealt with in terms of clause 40.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clause 30: Payment of annual fees</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Section 30 must be amended to make provision for the restoration of a lapsed application where the non-payment of a renewal fee was unintentional and the holder makes an application for restoration with no undue delay after becoming aware of the non-payment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cancellation of a Plant Breeder&rsquo;s Right due to non-payment of fees is one of the conditions prescribed in the UPOV Convention (article 10 of UPOV 1978 and Article 22 of UPOV 1991).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Department is not aware of any country that provides for a restoration of a PBR once it has been cancelled due to non-payment of fees.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Clause </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>32: Essentially derived varieties</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The wording should read &lsquo;...contemplated to 6(1), read with section 6(2) and section 6(3)&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clause 6 refers to inspection of documents. Reference to clause 7 in the Bill is correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clause 36: Hearing of application for and issue of compulsory licence</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Clause 36(10) it should be clarified that the payment would not be less than that paid by other licensees. DAFF is satisfied with the provision in its current form as it refers to &lsquo;equitable compensation&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clause 52: Offences and Penalties</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The holder of PBR should be allowed to calculate royalties in three ways: Ordinary licence fee, Actual damage, Actual profit of the infringer. The intention is for fines to be aligned to the Adjustment of Fines Act (Act 101 of 1991). On Section</p>\r\n\r\n<p>52(1)(b) it is suggested that any fine needs to take this into account. Section</p>\r\n\r\n<p>52(1)(b) makes infringement of PBR a criminal offence and requires government to police and enforce these rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no agreement that the clause is in conflict with the Constitution. Section 22 of the Constitution provides that the practice of trade, occupation or profession may be regulated by law. It is not correct to believe that the provisions are in conflict with national and international law. The Performers Protection Act, 1967; and Trade Marks Act, 1993, Canadian Plant Breeders&rsquo; Rights Act, 1990 and the Australian Plant Breeders&rsquo; Rights Act 1994 have similar provisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) institutes prosecutions. Prosecutions would only be instituted if there were sufficient evidence of such alleged offence. Also the clause protects those breeders who may not be able to go the civil route due to the expensive nature of civil cases.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>S</em>ections 51(3) and 52(1) as proposed, the Department submits, are fundamentally flawed and out of kilter and in conflict with fundamental human and constitutional rights, national and international intellectual property legislation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These Sections could result in the prosecution of poor sustenance farmers who, at first glance, appear to infringe PBR registrations (for example by selling farm-saved seed), but who do not have the financial resources to defend an action for infringement. This would result in these farmers potentially being guilty of an offence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Clause 53: Jurisdiction of the Magistrate&rsquo;s Courts</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Section 53 gives the magistrate&rsquo;s court jurisdiction. Given the complexity of PBR cases and the high fines and sentences, it is not suitable to limit jurisdiction to the magistrate&rsquo;s court. The High Court should have jurisdiction. This clause does not propose that a magistrate&rsquo;s court has exclusive jurisdiction in respect of hearing of offences under the Bill if the NPA decides to institute a prosecution in respect of an offence in a magistrate court. The clause empowers that magistrate&rsquo;s courts impose any penalty provided for in the Bill in respect of the offence even if it exceeds the jurisdiction of a magistrate&rsquo;s court in respect of punishments contemplated in Section 92 of the Magistrate&rsquo;s Courts Act. The NPA may decide to institute a prosecution in respect of an offence under the Bill in the regional court or a high court if the circumstances dictate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;Breeder&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The word person should be amended to person(s) to allow for plurality</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;Sell&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;Expose for sale&rsquo;; this is extremely wide and can introduce grounds for a legal dispute. Also includes exchange or otherwise dispose of to any person in any manner; this is too wide and this phrase should be followed with &lsquo;excluding testing purposes&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Clause 15: Varieties in respect of which plant breeders&rsquo; rights may be granted. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The current wording of Section 15(4) means that an applicant&rsquo;s own PBR application in another country would invalidate an application in SA, if the 1-year Convention deadline were missed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Clause </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>17: Priority</em> <em>and re-dating of applications</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The meaning and requirements of Section 17(3) are unclear. This sub-section needs to be reviewed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nClause 23: Denomination of a variety</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The wording of section 22(1) should be redrafted to &ldquo;<em>An applicant for the grant of a plant breeder&rsquo;s right must propose a denomination complying with the prescribed requirements and which shall be examined by the Registrar and approved if the denomination so complies.</em>&rdquo; The current wording does not reflect the true intention of the legislature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clause 30: payment of annual fees</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The grace period should be extended to 6 months as in the current Act. If payment is due in March would the cases filed under the old act still fall under 1 January? If not, what provision for protection would be provided between January and March once the Act comes to force?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Permissive wording used in relation to late payments falling within the mentioned three months post annuity deadline should instead be changed to mandatory wording. Alternative uses of the word <em>&ldquo;shall&rdquo; </em>and accompanying phrase <em>&ldquo;in order to&rdquo; </em>should disabuse any reader of any apparent ambiguity in the wording of the section in so far as it may disagree with the intent of the legislature this section.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clause 35: Application for compulsory licences</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This clause provides some guidance as to the intention of the phrases &lsquo;unreasonably refuses&rsquo;, reasonable requirements of the public, &lsquo;available at reasonable prices consistent with the holder of a plant breeder&rsquo;s right deriving a reasonable advantage there from&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clause 33: Remedies in respect of infringement of plant breeder&rsquo;s right</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Add Section 33(5) that allows PBR holder or licence holder to demand that the plant breeders&rsquo; right remove the infringing plants within 30 days or such reasonable longer periods as the courts may determine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Section 46: Entering premises</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Section 46(6) allows the Registrar to search any premises with consent from a PBR holder. This should be replaced with Section 24A(6) of the 1976 Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Clause 56: Transitional Provisions</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Section 56(2)(b) appears to be in conflict with Section 56(2)(a) and the term &ldquo;this Act&rdquo; in Section 56(2)(b) should be replaced with the term &ldquo;the 1976 Act&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>General comment</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Section 31 of the 1976 Act has been omitted. Section 31 of the 1976 Act may become important for food security or in the public interest in the future and it is submitted that this section should be included in the Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Farmers&rsquo; Rights: </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of giving in to pressure to join UPOV, our government should recognise the rights of farmers and put measures in place to enhance and conserve genetic diversity in their field. South Africa has been a member of UPOV since 1977. The rights to seed saving and exchange should be addressed in clause 10 of the Bill. DAFF has programmes on conservation and sustainable use of Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe development of a National Plan for the conservation and sustainable use of Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture is the strategic output of DAFF for 2016/17.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources in Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Africa, only Botswana, the Gambia, Mozambique, Somalia and South Africa have not signed. This means that South Africa does not recognise Farmers&rsquo; Rights, a situation that must be urgently addressed. South Africa has been a keen participant in the process leading up to the adoption of the Treaty. There has been national consultation on South Africa acceding to the Treaty</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UPOV 1978 and UPOV 1991.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>South Africa is, currently, a member of UPOV 1978 and is under no obligation to join UPOV 1991. UPOV 1991 is problematic in that it restricts re-use of protected seed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Clause 10 of the Bill is meant to provide for flexibility regarding farmers&rsquo; practices to re-use seed. There are stakeholders who support South Africa joining UPOV 1991. National consultations on South Africa&rsquo;s accession to UPOV 1991 have not yet been initiated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>WTO/TRIPS obligations</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Article 27.3.b of TRIPS obliges members to provide for the protection of plant varieties either by patents or by an effective <em>sui generis </em>system or by combination of both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SA as a member of WTO is not obliged to join either UPOV Conventions (1978 or 1991).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SA would still be in compliance with its obligations to WTO/TRIPS. It adopted a <em>sui generis </em>regime of PBRs that fully recognises the importance of heterogenous and adaptability of plant varieties to changing conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;UPOV is the recognized <em>sui generis </em>system that gives confidence to breeders to release their varieties into territories that have UPOV membership. Membership comprises 72 countries. There are four African countries: Kenya, Morocco, Tunisia and South Africa, and there is one African organisation, namely the African Intellectual Property Organization (OAPI) with UPOV membership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Discussion</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms A Steyn (DA), on Page 9, Section7 (2) and (3), suggested that &ldquo;magistrate&rdquo; be deleted, as it was agreed on the previous meeting. Then on Page 8, Section 5, she asked if it were possible to have both a fine and an imprisonment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adv Barry Beukes said it is possible to have both a fine and an imprisonment. The magistrate would be given grounds to consider that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr M Filtane (UDM), on Page 8, Section 5, line 3, suggested that &ldquo;intent&rdquo; be replaced with &ldquo;consequences&rdquo; because it is difficult to prove&rdquo;intent&rdquo;. On Page 11, Paragraph 2 sections 2 and 3, how do we make a reference to something that has been repealed?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adv Barry Beukes, on the issue of making a reference to something already repealed, indicated the legal team would look into the matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn, on the issue of transitional arrangements, wanted to find out if the magistrate would still hand over a license to the licensing officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adv Barry Beukes stated that Section 11B (3) makes provisions for the licensing officer to continue processing and issuing license for any application made before the enactment of the Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn pointed out that the Committee had not seen the Regulations that Section 7 is talking about because regulations could be chopped and changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson explained that the issue of regulations did not belong to the Committee but to the Minister.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Filtane asked, if the Department is under the assumption of not filing an application to the Concourt, would the Concourt consider the old application or assume the Department would file a new one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Songabe indicated that when the Minister made a request of a 12 months extension, the Concourt indicated it wanted to hear from other parties involved first, hence the granting of the two months waiting period. But after hearing that the NSPCA is not going to file an application, the Department then approached the Concourt. It is up to the Concourt to decide on whether it grants the request for 12 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An official from the Department indicated the Office of the State Attorney advised to file opposing arguments in the absence of the NSPCA. The Department was still awaiting response from the Concourt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms D Carter (COPE) asked if the Concourt would grant the Department an extension by 12 months, and wanted to know if there was any indication of when the judge would deliver the ruling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Phumelele Ngema, Parliamentary Legal Advisor, stated that Concourt indicated that the Minister of DAFF must file written arguments of not more than 20 pages in order to assist the court in the ruling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Carter said this would give the NSPCA a chance to file an application. Therefore, the Minister must file written arguments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An official from the Department assured the Committee that the NSPCA would not file opposing arguments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Response by DAFF to public hearings</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr T Ramokhoase (ANC) asked if reasonable inputs from stakeholders had been fairly considered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Netnou-Nkoana explained they had taken on board comments by stakeholders. The issues that stakeholders raised but could not go through would be raised and considered in the second round of hearings. Not all comments were considered, especially those that were not in line with the Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn asked how many stakeholders the Department dealt with and if some of their considerations were taken into account. She also asked for clarity on the international treaty and import conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Netnou-Nkoana, regarding comments by stakeholders, explained they had one on one meetings with certain stakeholders. The comments were inter-related and were grouped. There were sections that need to be re-looked and redrafted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pertaining to the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources in Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA), it is comprehensive to the rights of farmers. It has been in force for a number of years. It has been used for inclusion in the commercial material. The interest is more on the rights of the farmers. The Department is watching how developments are flowing to the provider countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the issue of import conditions, some SADEC countries are not clear and specific on this area. The Department needs to ensure that all bottlenecks are removed in the countries SA trades with so as to make trade easy. Many countries within SADEC have registered in the programme that deals with issues of trade, SADEC Harmonisation Programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Ramokhoase wanted clarity on UPOV 78/91.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Netnou-Nkoana stated that SA has signed UPOV 91 but it was never ratified. When a country moves from 78 to 91, it does not have to go through the process. The UPOV process covers SA because she has to deposit to 91.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The meeting was adjourned.</p>\r\n",

        "summary": "<p>The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) briefed the Committee on the Performing Animals Protection Amendment Bill and the Department&rsquo;s responses regarding public hearing comments on the Plant Breeders&rsquo; Rights Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Legal Administration Office of the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) took the Committee through the amendments and insertions contained in the Performing Animals Protection Amendments Bill (PAPA). The amendments were in Clauses 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, and were mainly around the changing of the words &ldquo;certificate&rdquo; to &ldquo;licence&rdquo;, &ldquo;dogs&rdquo; to &ldquo;animals for safeguarding&rdquo;, and the increase of fines and prison sentence from R4000 to R20 000 and from twelve months to five years, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Committee was also informed that during the processing of the Bill, and after the public hearings, it became clear that the consequential amendments of certain Sections of the principal Act were required to be added to those initially proposed by the Executive. These additional consequential amendments included Sections 4, 5 and 7 of the Principal Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A resolution was taken by the Committee to approach the Constitutional Court (Concourt) to request an extension of 12 months from the current deadline of 12 July 2015. DAFF filed an urgent application to the Concourt for the extension. The affidavit filed by DAFF centred around the fact that the additional amendments require the Committee, according to Rule NA249 (3b), to obtain permission from the National Assembly to amend other provisions or existing legislation other than those which the Executive had initially sought to amend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Concourt granted a short extension to 28 August 2015 instead of the 12 months requested in the founding affidavit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The view of the Concourt was that it is in the interest of justice that a written submission of not more than 20 pages be written by both parties &ndash; DAFF and NSPCA. However, the NSPCA informed the DAFF it would not file Heads of Arguments in the matter. DAFF is still awaiting feedback from the Constitutional Court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Committee was further briefed about the responses of the Department from the public hearing comments made by stakeholders regarding the Plant Breeders&rsquo; Rights (PBR). The comments focused on areas such as the right to apply for a PBR, protection given to the holder of plant breeder&rsquo;s rights, duration of plant breeder&rsquo;s right, exhaustion of plant breeder&rsquo;s right, transfer of a plant breeders&rsquo; right, and many others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members asked if the Concourt would grant the Department an extension of 12 months; wanted to know if there is any indication of when the judge would deliver the ruling; and if the Department was under the assumption of not filing an application to the Concourt, would the Concourt consider the old application or assume the Department would file a new one. With regard to public hearings, they wanted to establish if reasonable inputs from stakeholders have been fairly considered; asked the Department how many stakeholders it dealt with, and if some of their considerations were taken into account; and asked for clarity on the International Treaty, import conditions, and UPOV 78/91.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "body": "<p><strong>Chairperson&rsquo;s opening remarks</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson welcomed Members of the Portfolio Committee on Rural Development and Land Reform and the Chairperson and Members of the Portfolio Committee on Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries. There was going to be a joint sitting because of the overlapping issues, because without land there would be no agriculture, so in some instances the Committees had to work together to achieve the intended goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The agenda for the day dealt with the issue for Agri-Parks. The President in his State of the Nation Address had mentioned that 27 Agri-Parks would be established in the 27 districts of the country. The Minister had also referred to this, and the annual performance plan (APP) of the DRDLR presented to the Committee had highlighted that one of its activities would be the establishment of Agri-Parks in all 44 districts. It had therefore been decided to have a joint meeting with&nbsp;the Portfolio Committee on Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries to share information and to understand what the Departments were doing. The project involved all spheres of government, nationally, provincially and locally. The Departments would brief Members about the project, where it would be established, the impact of the project, how the project would benefit the youth, women and people with disabilities, as well as society at large. All the programmes should be beneficial to the people, and budgets for different departments had been approved with the understanding that the budget was a tool that was used to change the lives of the poor people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apologies had been received from the Minister and Deputy Minister of&nbsp;Agriculture,&nbsp;as well as the Director&nbsp;General. Apologies had also been received from the Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform, as well as the two Deputy Ministers. Two members of the Agriculture Portfolio Committee, Mr Z Mandela (ANC) and Ms T Tongwane (ANC) were attending other portfolio committees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson invited the Department of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) to make a presentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DAFF on Revitalisation of the Agriculture and Agro-Processing Value Chain</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Mortimer Mannya, Deputy Director General: Agricultural Production, Health and Food, DAFF,&nbsp;said the Department would present on the role that it would play and the DRDLR would provide more details. The presentation as requested provided an update to the joint Committees on progress made on the revitalisation and the linkage between the Agricultural Policy Action Plan (APAP) and Agri-Parks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Various departments were contributing to the priority stated in the State of Nation Address (SONA) in trying to ensure growth in the sector from the current 2.5 percent, and growing at a rate of 0.5 percent per annum. The intention to grow the sector would focus primarily on ensuring that there was growth in the agro-processing part, growth in the sector as a whole, and also on growing jobs. The focus was on the three issues and it was hoped and believed that the growth target would be improved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, there were challenges that had to be overcome for the indicated targets to be realised. The key challenges were high input costs primarily in animal feed, and this had to be overcome if growth was to be realised. A second challenge was competing interests for land, which had to be managed and balanced appropriately so that there was space for the various sectors that required land. Agriculture was concerned about the continued loss of high productive land to other non-agricultural uses, although it appreciated the need for use of land by non-agricultural sectors. The third constraint was in the anti-competitive behaviour which resulted from market dominance. This was another area where the Department needed to make inroads to realise growth. Climate change was a challenge which was realised in many ways such as droughts, floods, and fires, but also the degradation of soil as a whole which affected productivity of the soils. There was also a reduction in water supply, whether it was rain or stream flows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several interventions had been proposed and one of them was Agri-Parks, to ensure growth. Other interventions were fast-tracking land reform, improving producer support, ensuring that the nine identified strategic value chains were developed effectively, research and innovation and ensuring greater support for market access and trade development. The interventions would happen with specific enablers, such as policy certainty in a number of areas. There was also an assumption that high potential arable land would remain available. Other enablers were intensifying agriculture and agro-processing labour, otherwise there might be jobless growth. Also the growing demand for food and agro-products required ensuring food security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Mannya graphically demonstrated the multiplier effect that investment in the agriculture sector had on gross domestic product growth, job creation, export receipts and fiscal revenue, compared to other sectors. It was expected that every R1 million investment in agriculture would contribute ten jobs, and compared to other sectors agriculture had a greater potential for job creation and contributing greatly to the economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The role of DAFF in the Agri-Parks was largely around the services that the Department should provide. These ranged from consumer support, which was the Department&#39;s major role, capacity building, extension support and support to market access. The DRDLR would facilitate the physical aspect, such as access to land and infrastructure. The Department would ensure that farmers were supported to continue producing but also, when production was done, to utilise the market infrastructure made available, and the DAFF should ensure market linkages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of fast-tracking land reform, the Department had picked up the catalytic effect of the project. In the case of land reform, the strategic scope was ensuring agrarian transformation and completion and finalisation of a new policy framework. The&nbsp;Department&nbsp;was targeting to pilot ten properties, with a target of two million hectares of strategically located high-value agricultural land that had been acquired for the key value chain by 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To improve producer support, the important part was to ensure that the players -- the farmers or the producers -- were supported adequately. In comparison with other countries, South Africa provided the lowest support to producers. This was not good for growth and it was one of the major areas&nbsp;that had to be worked on, otherwise all other efforts would become useless. The target was to increase producer support from 3.2 percent to five percent by 2019. In terms of progress, the Department was trying to finalise two types of policy -- the Comprehensive Producer Support policy framework and the Integrated Agriculture Development Finance policy -- for Cabinet submission. The Department was also ensuring that the Agriculture Training strategy for training smallholder farmers was finalised and was being implemented at the moment. The revitalisation of the agriculture school in the Eastern Cape, which was funded by the Department of Science and Technology, had also been finalised. The Department was providing support through the Comprehensive Agricultural Support Programme (CASP) and Illema to 60 943 farmers, to the tune of R2.1 billion. These were producers in areas where Agri-Parks had been identified, and who would receive support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were also challenges and decisions that had to be made to ensure progress and reach the set targets. The first challenge was that there were ineffective models of producer support and there was a need to continue improving in this area. There was also the absence of uniform criteria and definitions, which created confusion when not harmonised. The Department needed to work on harmonisation with various departments and agencies supporting the farmers. DAFF was proposing a new policy and model for producer support that focused on the smallholder farmer. The Department was also reviewing the existing financial instruments to see what progress had been made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAnother challenge was the slow pace in issuing of water licences. Agriculture was largely dependent on water, particularly now when faced with climate change challenges. There was a need to fast-track and emphasise it. The proposal was to submit a list of strategic projects to the Department of Water and Sanitation to prioritise the licensing processes. There was also a challenge of the proposed incentive programme for Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA), which was not funded at the moment. The Department was looking at submitting a proposal for funding to the Green Fund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As already indicated, competing demand for land was a challenge but it was hoped that the Preservation and Development of Agricultural Land Framework (PDALF) and the Spatial Planning and Land Use Management Act (SPLUMA) would be harmonised to ensure that protection of agricultural land was dealt with. The Department would also continue to engage with the Department of Mineral Resources to finalise on how to deal with the co-existence of mining, to balance the various interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were national training programmes across the country. The training programmes were for credit-bearing training and non-credit bearing training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Mannya said a number of value chains had been identified. One of the value chains was for poultry, which had the potential to contribute to one million hectares of under-utilised land in communal areas and land reform to production. There was also potential to contribute to two percent annual growth in Gross Value Add of the sector. The Department targeted to add 14 000 jobs to the current 107 000 jobs by increasing poultry production. Expansion of soya production would add another 14 000 jobs. Soya was required for poultry feed so as poultry production grew, there was a greater demand for feed and therefore there would be need to grow the number of hectares where soya was produced. There was also a target to increase the contribution of the gross value of agriculture to the GDP from the current R32.1 billion to R41.13 billion by 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within the current financial year, the private sector would invest in planting 687 300 hectares to produce almost one million tonnes of soya beans. At the same time, the public sector had acquired 1 536 hectares of land, which had increased the land for soya to 3 647 hectares. This was still not adequate, and the public sector side would still fall short.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The challenges facing this particular value chain included the fact that some of the projects that were almost ready were not moving as they should. A political intervention had been requested in Limpopo, where an abattoir had been revitalised with a state of the art poultry abattoir, which could unlock 2 000 jobs and support about 18 broiler houses around the abattoir. The abattoir had not been operational for a number of years and it was hoped that with the intervention, there would be some progress and the abattoir would become operational before the end of the year. Another challenge was import dumping, and the Department was ensuring that provinces would cluster projects and transform the projects into bankable poultry programmes. High input costs were also a challenge, and the Department was looking at public private partnerships (PPPs) with the various departments and IDC to invest in crushing facilities. Agri-Parks would also help to take this into consideration, as some of the Agri-Parks sites could also involve the poultry value chain. Infrastructure had been developed for various CASP projects in various provinces</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The red meat value chain would also contribute to the utilisation of one million hectares of land that were not utilised to contribute to the annual growth in Gross Value Add in the sector. The Department had targeted to create 75 000 jobs in the beef and mutton sector. Progress made was through the contribution of the private sector, with most animals in the communal and smallholder sector. Therefore there was a need to acquire more land to ensure that there was 1.3 million hectares available to produce red meat. There was a programme of deploying veterinarians to provide support to the value chains, to ensure that there was continuous access to the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The challenge in this particular sector was that there was a growing demand for red meat products which was not being met. Therefore in the meantime, the demand had to be compensated for with imports. Although there was work around community veterinary services, the services were inadequate at the moment and support had to grow to ensure that veterinary services improved in totality. Support should not just be in the form of people, but there should also be facilities which would include diagnostic laboratories and a supply of the required veterinary medicines. There was also a challenge with the commercialisation of communal herds, because most animal herds were within the communal areas. The Department had to ensure there was growth in the understanding and provision of support to commercialise the herds, and that the value of the herds was realised. DAFF was proposing a buy-in and use of PPPs with various traditional authorities to expand the herds. The provision of animal handling facilities also formed part of this investment and intervention. Several projects were supported in the red meat value chain in the CASP/ Ilema-Letsema project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other value chain projects were wheat and other crops, fruit and vegetables, sugar and wine. The bigger challenges that had to be dealt with were around vital sanitary methods. There were also challenges in the fresh produce market related to infrastructure, which had become almost derelict. Investment in infrastructure was needed to ensure it was brought back for the benefit of various producers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the sugar value chain, the Department had to ensure that the underutilised hectares were used by planting more sugar. The challenges were around land claims in those areas. For the wine value chain, the target was that the 99 463 hectares under vineyard production could be increased by adding an additional 4 707 hectares by 2019. This would contribute to growing the GDP, from R30 billion to R32 billion by 2019. The challenges faced in the sector were more trade related, but the sector was also the least transformed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If inroads were to be made and structures developed, then there was a need for technology development and innovation. The agenda of research, innovation and technology development had to be elevated, otherwise it would not be possible to improve the gains despite the other investments made in other areas. At the moment, less than 0.1 percent of agriculture&rsquo;s GDP was invested in research and development annually. This would have to grow through improved governance. The challenge was that the current investment was very low, and it had to grow to two or three percent.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The current capacity in terms of human resources and expertise was limited. The infrastructure in the sectors was also inadequate and needed to be improved, and there was an ageing human capacity. A cost benefit analysis in the area was being worked on to ensure that the time and investment was being grown by two to three percent. There were a few projects led by the Department of Science and Technology to address the challenges in this very important supportive part of growing the agriculture value chains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The last area dealt with issues of market access and trade. There was a need to increase the market access for agriculture, forestry and fisheries both nationally and internationally. There was also a need to increase export trade and reduce imports consistently. The other catalytic effect would be ensured growth in participation of small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) and smallholders throughout the value chain. The target was to ensure that there were 200 Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) certified smallholders. The Department was working with the Perishable Products Export Control Board (PPECB) to enhance the capacity. Progress made so far was that farms had been identified for audits and SA GAP certification. Negotiations had also been initiated with one of the colleges that would work with the PPECB to provide the training that was required. Part of it would require improved record keeping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The challenge that had to be overcome was to ensure that local procurement that was under the National Treasury and the Department of Small Business Development was speeded up and completed. The Department would ensure greater synergy between the Industrial Policy Action Plan (IPAP) and the Agricultural Policy Action Plan (APAP) around the commodities that would supply and support the agro-processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson thanked DAFF for the presentation and invited the DRDLF to make a presentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson added that when acronyms were used in the presentations there should be a footnote to explain the meaning of each and every acronym used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DRDLR progress report on Agri-Parks</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Leona Archary, Deputy Director General: DRDLR said the presentation would give an indication of where the Department was in terms of the actual conceptualisation so that there was a common understanding even as the Agri-Parks were being rolled out. Issues of progress would also be dealt with and clarify where the DRDLR was in terms of the terminology used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The concept of the Agri-Parks programme drew from existing models in the country, as well as the rest of the world. These included educational farms, experimental farms, collective farming, farm incubation projects, agri-clusters, eco villages, urban-edge allotments and market gardens. This was important, because it had been found that in the country there were various definitions of what an Agri-Park would look like when it was completed. The DRDLR had looked at everything that existed and had tried to find a way for everything to fit into the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The proposed model would make use of both public and private land. This would also serve as a transition zone between urban and agricultural land uses. The naming of the concept as a Park was intended to convey the role that the Mega-Park would play, as open space preservation was dealt with. While the term suggested permanent land conservation and recreational use exemplified by the park, it would also evoke a traditional model of an agricultural business park or hub, where multiple tenants and owners operated under a common management structure. The Agri-Parks would also provide networks of contacts between producers&rsquo; markets and processors, as well as the physical infrastructure required for transforming the industry. Focus would be primarily on the processing of agricultural products but to a limited extent opportunities would also be given to other types of industries to exist. At the moment, the focus was on agriculture and the linkage with surrounding agricultural land that would be utilised for production. The approach would include the selection and training of smallholder farmers as well as selecting farms per province for placement, incubation and training of unemployed graduates and agro-entrepreneurs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Agri-Parks would be farmer-controlled and the Department was currently working on this in terms of defining how farmer control would occur. This would link to the Land Reform Programme through bringing sustainability within the programme, to increase production in all of the activities currently happening in the rural space. The model would have a strong social mobilisation component so that black farmers and agri-business entrepreneurs were mobilised and organised to support this particular initiative. A critical component would be the partnerships, not only with government but with the private sector as well, and with all three spheres of government working together to make the initiative work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DRDLR would also be focusing on utilising the state land already in possession for production and processing sites. For that purpose, the 25 farms per province would be linked directly to this particular programme in terms of state farms, as well as the Animal and Veld Management Programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Archary said guiding principles had been set out and were utilised to assess the business plans that were coming through. The guiding principles basically ensured that control remained with the farmers themselves. The essence of Agri-Parks was to bring land into production, but at the same time move in terms of production to the value add that was desired in terms of the processing component. The idea was also&nbsp;that the programme would provide&nbsp;support to growing towns and the revitalisation of rural towns through high economic growth, high population growth, etc.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the DRDLR had started with the whole model of the Agri-Park programme, it had started with a mega Agri-Park followed by linkages to all the other things that would need to happen for it to work. Basically this meant understanding fully well that this was a matter of supply and demand and ensuring increased supply at the production level. In addition, account had to be taken of market access issues so that what was produced was found on the market both locally and internationally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Agri-Park development hub model was intended to have various activities around processing, adding other services around social services, retail services and so forth. The model was also beginning to show that linkages would be surrounding municipalities as well as the villages to ensure that production elements and other activities happened at a localised stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Levers were used to ensure strengthening of the current programmes of government. The internal levers used were the Animal and Veld Management Programmes (AVMP), the River Valley Catalytic Programme (RVCP), the Recapitalisation and Development Programme (RECAP), Restitution, Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies (PLAS), the National Rural Youth Service Core Programme, and the Revitalisation of Rural Towns. Externally there was APAP which was aligned to CASP, Ilema-Letsema, Municipal Infrastructure Grant (MIG) funding, the Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP), Community Works Programme (CWP), food banks and other programmes that might already exist within the DTI. The private sector was also utilised by using expertise that already existed in the commodity sector, such as cooperatives, markets and agri-businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The strategic objectives of the Agri-Parks were the establishment of the parks in all districts of the country with the intention of contributing to the targets set out in the Medium Term Strategic Framework (MTSF) and the NDP. Agri-Parks would promote growth of the smallholder sector by contributing to the 300 000 new small-scale producers, as well as to the 145 000 new jobs in agro-processing by 2020. The DRDLR also wanted to promote skills and support to smallholder farmers and strengthen existing partnerships to ensure sustainability. In terms of how ownership of the actual components of the AgriParks would work, it was proposed that there should be an equity split, with 70 percent going to the producers and 30 percent to the state, and commercial interests holding minority shares in the 30 percent. The Department was currently working on the modelling of this with people who had expertise in the area on how the equity modelling would unfold. The work was expected to be completed in the next few weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smallholders would also be allowed to take full control of the park and steadily decrease state support over a period of ten years. The idea was for the state to support the initiative only over a period of ten years. Underutilised land would be brought into production and contribute to the NDP in total.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Agri-Parks were made not to be just one particular site in a particular district, but rather linking the site from the level of production and moving up to the level of processing, to the level of market access. The Department was suggesting that the Agri-Park would be an innovative system of agro-production, processing, logistics, marketing, and training and extension services. There would be three components, the first component being the Farmer Production Support Unit (FPSU), which would have a rural outreach unit connected with the Agri hub itself. The FPSU would do primary collection, some storage, some processing for the local market and extension services, including mechanisation. The second component was the Agri Hub Unit, which was where key processing would happen. Agri hubs would also do other activities, including packaging, logistics and training. The Department believed that training, research and development and the use of new technology was going to be critical for the sustainability of the Agri-Parks programme. The third component was linking the Rural Urban Market Centre (RUMC) unit, which had three main purposes. The first was to link the rural and urban areas in terms of market access, both locally and internationally. The second purpose was to act as a holding facility, and lastly to provide market intelligence which was critical, as it would enable producers to ensure that even on the urban edge the Agri-Parks would still be able to find a space, even at a retail level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Archary presented a diagrammatic representation which showed the linkages where the Agri-Park model began to talk to both commercial farmers on the one hand and the smallholder farmers on the other. This was not just a model or programme that could benefit only land reform farmers or other smallholder farmers in communal areas, but should benefit all farmers within a particular space. Even in the light of the different support components, the level of FPSU might be used more by smallholder farmers, cooperatives and communal farmers. The commercial farmers might actually find themselves going directly to the Agri Hub component, where major processing could happen. The RUMC would then help in terms of market access to link all the farmers in that particular area. There was an obvious linkage to the market, which was the demand component that had been referred to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stakeholders in the Agri-Parks at the farmer level were commonage farmers, traditional area farmers, smallholder farmers and commercial farmers. All these were supported at different levels by the FPSU, the Agri-Hub component of the Agri-Park, and then by RUMC that was being proposed. There were slides in the presentation which showed what might emerge in districts because of the way the Agri-Parks were being modelled and because of wanting to get as close as possible to the farmers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than one FPSU might emerge and some of them already existed, so it was about the Department confirming the existence, and also that the services provided were adequate or expanded where they were needed most at the local level. These would have to provide extension services, doing some level of processing such as smaller milling for household consumption, and being able to give the farmers some market information at that level. These would then be linked to one Agri-Hub in a district. The Agri-Hub talked about should have major processing facilities, retail facilities, demonstration farms and housing to accommodate workers at the Agri-Hubs themselves, but also accommodation for those who came for training at the facilities. All these would be supported by an RUMC, which did not have to be one per district. For instance, the Luba trade park in KwaZulu-Natal could be an example of an area that could be used at that RUMC, with expansion in terms of specific needs for the rural producers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The static model in terms of how the Agri-Park was seen emerging and its catchment area in terms of the Agri-Parks itself, showed it would be able to support more than one FPSU. These would then link the producers to the RUMC. The model showed there could be a far wider reach,&nbsp;even though it was placed in one central point&nbsp;in a particular district.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FPSU would consist of an agriculture extension support office, local mechanisation, primary collection, sorting and smaller storage facilities, among other things. Agri-Hubs would become a key part of processing that was to be brought into the district. There would be a retail facility, an administrative facility, machinery and mechanisation support, packaging, quality control, agro-processing, a training centre, research and demonstrations, student and staff housing, etc. There would be the necessary processing and storage depending on the commodity produced. These could be silos, red meat or poultry abattoirs, and the necessary packaging to take the produce where it was required. Issues to be considered in the Agri-Park were the catchment area, the type of farmer, its density and how it would impact the Agri-Park network. The Department had tried to put as much information into the park so that linkages could be seen at the most localised level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the linkages to RUMC were done in the manner proposed by the Department, the catchment areas would overlap across the country and would ensure full production over future years. The project would be carried out in phases over the next five to ten years in order to get to the point of full coverage. In terms of the catchment areas, the DRDLR was proposing that for the FPSU, which would be at the most localised level -- where there was low density in terms of farmers -- a catchment area of 30 kilometres was suggested. Where there was a higher density of farmers, the catchment area would be ten kilometres. For the Agri-Hubs, the Department was suggesting a 120 kilometre radius for low density and a 60 kilometre radius where there was high farmer density. The RUMC would be at a 250 kilometre radius where there was low farmer density, and 150 kilometre radius for high farmer density.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Archary said since the Department had started working on the Agri-Parks project, it had been working on a high level project programme. Some areas had been completed and some work was on track and the Department was well within the particular programme that had been tabled originally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Slide 35 of the presentation indicated areas that had been confirmed. The programme had initially started in 27 districts and had then proceeded to all 44 districts of the country. So far 39 sites had been confirmed across the entire country in terms of the Agri-Parks themselves. The provincial Departments of Agriculture were the lead partners in terms of site identification, as well with the district. The North West Province was one of the provinces that were far ahead with the programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Slide 36 mapped out the proposed sites that had been selected and it was believed that these would become the core in terms of the Agri-Hubs component of the Agri-Park itself. The site would then be linked to the most localised level, as close as possible to the farmer in terms of the FPSU.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of the budget allocation, DRDLR had already committed R2 billion for the current financial year, which would be utilised in all of the 44 districts as it drove the Agri-Parks roll out. The money would be used differently, depending on the phases of the project as they emerged in the business plans of each district. Some of the money would be used for infrastructure and others on the production element, which would become crucial if the programme was to become a success. The Department was in the process of finalising the budgets, and the budget component of the programme would be completed at the end of the month. The budget commitments would be from other departments, as well as provincial governments and the private sector. The budget had two sections -- the first was on production, and the other on the Agri-Parks themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Slides 39 to 40 showed what was being used as a poster/flier, so that everyone would know where they were supposed to be in a particular month. In the month of June, the Department was busy with consultations, which had actually started much earlier in the process. The Department was consulting with farmers, communities, the private sector and other sector departments in terms of the modelling that had been put on the table. It was now busy with the farm assessments so that it could develop with DAFF the detailed production plan for each identified area. The intention was not to miss the current planting season while still working on the designs and infrastructure build of the Agri-Parks component. If done this way, the programme should be on the ground in September as far as either production or actual processing was concerned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Department was doing several things to check the readiness of each particular province, looking at different areas from site identification, consultations, farmer mobilisation, and production plans up to the point of being on the ground in terms of construction and actual implementation. This was included because it was a dashboard that the Department was using for monitoring what was happening in each of the districts. The Free State planning progress had been included in the presentation to show how they had utilised the Department&#39;s proposal and matched it to the identified Agri-Parks sites in the province. The Free State was advanced even in identifying the commodities that were being produced in the surrounding areas. The province was able to show how it was linking on the model -- for instance, from the central point to where the farmers existed in particular areas. The maps also showed the Agri-Hubs and the linkages to where the farmers existed within the catchment areas.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were also examples showing where the livestock were and how they could be used in terms of the red meat component of the Agri-Park itself. The examples had been inserted just to show Members the readiness of the provinces themselves. The Free State example showed how it had conceptualised farm inputs right up to the retail stage and the value chains that would be worked on in the Agri-Parks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An example from the Xhariep showed how the Municipality had already mapped where each farmer existed surrounding the Agri-Park, and what commodity was being produced at the moment. Therefore looking at the Xhariep Agri-Park, it was already known what type of farmers existed -- red meat farmers, ostrich farmers, wool production, fish projects -- and these were the types of processing that would happen in the actual Agri-Hub component of the model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Springbokpan in the North West, work was also at an advanced level. There were recently renovated silos in that particular area which had been used as a catalyst for their project. The silos had already been matched with willing components, as well as other areas that might be found within an Agri-Park. Surrounding farmers had already been determined in the area and 20 000 hectares of land had already been put under production to support the silos and milling operations, as well as the expansion of the full design of all the other components. There was also another example to show that Springbokpan was one of the areas which was far advanced. Construction was already on site, including a partnership that had already emerged through private sector funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Springbokpan had also moved in terms of unpacking their production, processing stages and market stages. What was shown in the pictures was what was actually happening on the ground for the North West. &nbsp;The provincial Departments of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Development, had committed R140 million for the current financial year and the DRDLR had committed R45 million. There was also an additional funding of R45 million as well as private sector funding and partnerships that had already emerged with Omnia for production support as well as tractors that would be used. A fully costed model of the Agri-Parks for the next few years had already been done and it amounted to R464 million.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Provincial consultations had been concluded but the Department was still busy in the Western Cape because they had brought in late in terms of the number of districts. One site had already been confirmed and there were three districts which had to be concluded. Governance structures had been established at a multi-disciplinary special task team level, was chaired by the Department&#39;s Director General (DG) and comprised of DGs of the DAFF, DTI, the Departments of Water and Sanitation, Science and Technology, and Small Business Development, the head of Provincial Agriculture and municipal managers, as well as the nominated DDGs from the respective departments. The Department had also aligned the programme closely with the outcome seven programme so that it was able to feed in at all levels in terms of the work that was being done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Provincial multi-disciplinary task teams had also been established, which were chaired by the head of department of Provincial Agriculture and supported by DRDLR and other relevant Provincial departments. It included the middle management service (MMS) and other officials from the Provincial DAFF and DRDLR. At an operational level, there was an operations management task team that met on a weekly basis both at the Province as well as at national level. At the moment, project teams were being established for each district as the actual business plans were rolled out. The operation task team at the Department was chaired by the DDG and included the DAFF, and all the programmes within the Department and additional departments were being brought into the structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently the Department was busy with the state of readiness of all the business plans that had been tabled. It was moving on to identify the actual projects that would be done by doing infrastructure assessments and identifying the projects themselves with a detailed costing. It was also working on finalising the structure of the Agri-Park itself and the production plan so as not to miss the current planting season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson asked if the Department could highlight the government structures. There was the Comprehensive Rural Development Plan (CRDP) which was called the council of stakeholders, now there was Agri-Parks, and other Committees were being established. How were the Committees going to be aligned to work together to avoid duplication? Had the Department done enough in consultation with smallholder farmers from the foundation phase, as to where the Agri-Parks would be established? &nbsp;Monitoring of the effective implementation of the plan, as presented, seemed to be a problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr T Mhlongo (DA) asked about the budget versus the strategy and how the challenge of access to markets was going to be addressed. Had a feasibility study been done? Had the working model been compared to the other international models that the Department had reviewed? He was concerned with the challenge of coordination, as both departments were involved. There was the CRDP which had also had a lack of coordination -- how were Members going to be convinced that this would be a success, as there had been problems before? What was the difference between the CRDP and the Agri-Parks?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hr asked for more details on monitoring. The Department had talked about the involvement of locals --were municipalities involved? Would the private sector be involved?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr A Madella (ANC) said the presentation was very insightful and gave Members the background to go forward in terms of changing the landscape of agriculture in the rural areas. He was compelled to raise the question around the Western Cape, as it was an integral part of South Africa, but there seemed to be some kind of hesitation in the Western Cape. He asked about the Department&#39;s ability to accelerate the process as only one site had been identified and three other sites still needed to be identified. Where was the site that had been identified? When would the site identification process be finalised? An issue had been raised about the structures, which in many ways were comprised of the same stakeholders. He wished to add the issue of District Land Committees, which were in the process of being launched nationwide, and asked how they would be involved in the process, particularly at the municipal level. For example, it was common for the same person from a municipality to be sitting in all the structures. To what extent were the local communities being canvassed, informed or consulted on this? Were they looking forward to the Agri-Parks as something that would change their lives?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr M Filtane (UDM) said the programme sounded quite exciting and he hoped it would be a game changer in the context of food security. &nbsp;Once it was in full production -- probably in the next year or so -- how many types of food would be produced? In South Africa, a large percentage of the food was produced by commercial farmers, and he believed this had to be changed sooner rather than later. Based on his experience of working with communities, he knew there was a tendency for communities to start expecting a stipend from government whenever the government brought a project to the area. Communities felt they had to be compensated for working on those mealie fields. Had the Department made provision for that, because it would surely come across that situation?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Filtane asked if soil tests had been done to ascertain suitability and availability because there would be a centre for processing, but he assumed that the produce would be coming from different parts of a given district. He asked about ownership, as the Department had spoken about owner-controlled Agri-Parks, which had been broken down to 70 percent and 30 percent by the state. If stakeholder A owned the land but did not produce, and if stakeholder C actually processed, they would all be stakeholders in the programme. How would stakeholder A, who owned the land be handled, and how would stakeholder C be handled? Would they all have ownership in the programme and if not, how would their expectations and aspirations be handled? Why did the state want to have a stake at all? How would this be treated, or how would government&rsquo;s stake be weaned down, if at all?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr T Walters (DA) felt the joint Committee meeting was a good concept. One of the gaps in the presentation related to value chains. He could see the advantages and everything, and asked if a market had already been determined on which to base the approach. There was no point making the land productive if there was no market. Two points related to the wine and sugar export markets, was how the market was determined or how the Department did an industry analysis for the interventions to take place. He thought this would differ from area to area and product type. How did the Department go about beneficiary selection? Much as there were other social priorities, the ultimate objective should be to favour emerging farmers and change the ownership structure of land in South Africa. There should be successful farmers who were also agricultural entrepreneurs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over and above the funding model from the state providing a certain infrastructure, how would finance ultimately work once the state walked away? What type of financing model would be put in place? He felt the issue of financing also related to land ownership. The Chairperson had talked about the alignment of different structures, like district committees and Agri-Parks, but also the governance part. It was one thing to say the stakeholders were there, but that in itself did not guarantee good governance of this particular model going forward. How did the Department intend to deal with that? When government walked away from the programme, how would the governance model work to ensure that it continued working well?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Walters noted that distance had been used as a catchment guideline. Why was that an accurate system -- why not product type, or soil quality, or other types of guidelines?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms A Steyn (DA) felt the joint meeting was long overdue. She focused on the presentation by DAFF, because the presentation by DRDLR had contained a lot of detail without any specifics. The pictures were wonderful, but she could not tell how much of it was in the planning stage and how much was already on the ground. For that reason she could not ask questions on the rural development aspect of the presentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The challenges raised in the DAFF&#39;s presentation were also the challenges that she had in mind. She could not see this aspect in the DRDLR presentation, perhaps because each department had its own focus. She was concerned about the challenges on the agricultural side because they were what would challenge the whole plan. These were the challenges that people suffered on a daily basis in agriculture today. If the government could not fix the challenges, then agriculture would not thrive in South Africa. She mentioned a few challenges, one of which was policy certainty. There was a need to have policy certainty not only on land, but a on whole range of other issues.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She said input costs were a challenge, and recalled a Land Reform oversight to KZN, where all the farmers had informed the Committee that electricity was a problem. Farmers paid&nbsp;a lot of money in accessibility costs, which was just for an electrical line to the farm, and not for the actual electricity. These were the realistic issues that had to be talked about and if solutions could not be found, all the brilliant plans and wonderful ideas would end there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She said she did not live far from Springfontein and passed it twice a week when travelling to and from Parliament. Technical capacity was an issue. She had started at the local council in Xhariep Municipality in the Eastern Cape, and the municipality had wanted to do all these things like the commodity value chains in ostrich farming, wool, and sheep, but could not because there was no water, and many other things which were not available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn said the DAFF presentation had indicated that a prototype Agri-Park had been completed. She asked where it was and if the Committee could visit it. A challenge in acquiring land and property had been indicated, but why was this a challenge? If this was happening in the way that she thought it should be happening, it could be on any land and it could also be linked to cost. If someone wanted to build all this, would it be on state land and who would own it. She thought it was one of the problems that banks had, as they could not put millions of Rands into something that had no clear ownership. Who owned the land at the end of the day? All these things had to get in line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The programme had a massive cost implication. She was not trying to shoot the programme down, but was trying to be realistic. She was a dreamer and wanted things to happen in South Africa -- that was why she was where she was. She had started to get these things going in her local municipality. She said that R2 billion was not going to kick start one thing, let alone in 44 districts. What would the R2 billion be used for? Was it going to be for the seeds for planting, or was it going to be for building silos -- what would be the first thing, as it was a chicken and egg situation. There could not be a silo without planting, and there could be no planting if there was no silo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr E Nchabeleng (ANC) said the issue of cost would be a challenge. The provision of water or connection to a system would affect the budget. He agreed with Ms Steyn about the cost of electricity. He asked what the link was between the Agri-Parks and the revitalisation of irrigation schemes. Would the two be linked?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He had met some colleagues in the Eastern Cape who had raised issues about structures that had been revitalised some years ago. A lot of money had been invested in those structures, and they were not being used. Now something else was being talked about. How was it going to be linked to the revitalised irrigation schemes?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some pieces of land had been given to communities through the restitution processes. Would these people be a part of this programme? If so, how would they fit in so that money was not spent in such a way that projects ended up linking? Many years ago, in the first administration, an RDP document had been produced which talked about building the economy, using local resources. The document had also talked about appropriate technologies, if one was living in an area where there was drought and serious water shortages. It would not make any sense to put an electric pump and drill a bore hole that would be dry within six months, but if a windmill was put up, water usage would be controlled and the cost would be very low. There would still be quality in what one was doing through proper planning. Agriculture had been done for thousands of years, even before electricity, and there were never problems with some of the things that always needed to have electricity connected. There were other methods for getting energy cost-effectively. Solar energy could also be used. If problems were driven by consultants it was because consultants would always cut a niche for themselves for the future -- and even created a market for their other products. He suggested going back to the drawing board and making reference to the appropriate technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms A Qikani (ANC) had a few questions about sites. In the Eastern Cape there were some sites that had been identified, particularly at Amathole in Butterworth. She asked if the municipality had been consulted during the identification of the sites. Butterworth was surrounded by chiefs, and she asked if consultations had been done and if the sites had already been identified. If so, where were the identified sites in Butterworth?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms N Magadla (ANC) said the Department had talked about private sector investment and growth. What was needed in the country was economic growth and jobs in both the rural and urban sectors. In the DRDLR presentation it had been indicated that R2 billion had been allocated by the Department. How much had been allocated by other departments and the private sector? There was a challenge of ageing senior researchers. Was there a layer of researchers to fill these vacancies?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Z Jongbloed (DA) asked how Agri-Parks linked to the DTI&#39;s economic zones. From the presentation it seemed as though there had been wide consultations with just about everybody, including farmers. The presentation had also mentioned a multi-disciplinary task team. She asked if the Department could inform Members as to who exactly served on the task teams. It was quite disconcerting that so little mention had been made of the Western Cape, and she asked if the Department could perhaps explain what the plans for the Western Cape were.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr C Maxegwana (ANC) commented that if the Department had decided to take the route of rapid rural transformation, there was a need to come up with ideas to ensure that transformation occurred, and this was in the hands of the two or three departments. The DAFF and DRDLR could not do much without water, and therefore some working arrangement in terms of that had to be done by the government. He made the comment, because the Agri-Parks was a serious decision taken by the government. If mistakes committed in the past were to be corrected, as raised by other Members, what was needed was to ensure effective monitoring. The good ideas had to be followed through or implemented through monitoring. The funding allocated would have to be closely monitored in each of the Provinces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DAFF had said it would provide support services and marketing agencies. How would this be done? How were small and rural towns going to fit into this? How was DAFF going to assist those smallholder farmers to ensure that things were happening, as there were problems there. &nbsp;It was said that 36 of the 44 districts had confirmed sites -- which districts were they?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr P Mnguni (ANC) wished there was more time, or perhaps a workshop, to address all the issues that Members still had, to ensure that what was being discussed as the programme moved forward was scientifically correct. He appreciated the format of the presentation from DAFF that focused on decisions, targets, activities, challenges and recommendations, which was very close to the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA). The Department had talked about strategic goals, targets, activities and so forth so that it could easily be held accountable. The Department had been creative about it and had at least talked to the jargon of the PFMA and the format. He encouraged the DRDLR to do the same. Slides 17 to 22 of DAFF&#39;s presentation talked about a contribution to 1 million hectares of communal area, and he asked if the hectares were really in communal areas. For instance, in the Western Cape, were communities really nicely ploughing wheat and fruit, as the Department had&nbsp;talked about the strategic scope in communal areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On slide 41 of DRDLR&#39;s presentation, the only words on the slide were &ldquo;planning progress per province,&rdquo; and he had expected to see the progress reports of each province. What had followed was nothing close to that and the DDG in her presentation had given an example of the Free State. The Department was representing the whole of South Africa, but the presentation had ended up being an example of the Free State. In the documentation, it was really the Free State, and there might have been slides about the Eastern Cape as well. He asked if the Free State was the leading province in terms of implementation of Agri-Park, or was it the average one? Was the Free State the lowest performing and therefore the Department was driving the provinces from behind from the lowest performance? If not, should the Department be held accountable to give details per province within seven days?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson asked the Department to respond to the questions raised by members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DRDLR response</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Mduduzi Shabane, Director General, DRDLR, said the presentations by the two departments formed part of the nine Presidential interventions in the State of the Nation Address (SONA) aimed at revitalising agriculture and the agro-processing value chain. The two were complementary and were no longer problems of the DRDLR and DAFF. The two issues were monitored at a cluster level at the level of the DG, and were also monitored at the level of Ministers in the economic sectors, employment and infrastructure development cluster. There was high level political oversight across all the nine programmes. Each of the nine priority interventions was led by a Minister with a group of Deputy Ministers from various sector departments. For instance, in the case of revitalising the agriculture and agro-processing value chain, it was led by the Minister of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries. The priority intervention of rural development through Agri-Parks and the speeding up of land reform played a critical role. The Department of Water Affairs and Sanitation sat on the teams that oversaw the programmes so that when a question of water availability arose, it was part of the team. He was illustrating the point that it was not just DAFF and DRDLR that were sitting and working.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The issue of monitoring and evaluation had been raised. At the Director General cluster level, there was a project management unit that had been set up, led by the Department of Science and Technology, the DRDLR and the DTI. These were the departments that were overseeing the tracking of each one of the nine priorities, including the one on agriculture and agro-processing. The DTI was centrally involved. The issues of market and trade analysis came from the DTI, but part of the market analysis was done by the DAFF through its agency, the National Agriculture Marketing Council. One of the things that the agency had been asked to analyse was government procurement of food and food related stuffs. It had been established that there was a lot of money being spent by government, whether procuring food for hospitals, schools, prisons, and the Defence Force, and some of the food that was procured by the state was imported. There was no challenge of a market, but the government had to guarantee that through Agri-Parks and through APAP, there was security of supply. For instance, if service providers were contracted to supply food to prisons, Correctional Services could not be asked to cancel the contract that the Agri-Parks would supply when there was no capacity. The same would apply to health, or the defence force. The DG of DRDLR had already personally spoken to all the heads of those institutions. On the demand side there was no problem, but what had to be guaranteed was the provision of products.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Shabane said recently there had been contributions from colleagues in the DTI, which would be making a financial contribution in this particular space. &nbsp;The Department of Transport (DoT) and the Department of Public Works (DPW) had been added to the product team because some of the infrastructure would require the two departments and their agencies to fix some of the infrastructure. For instance, the DoT was critical because of some of the agencies that the Department managed. Some of the rail infrastructure that was in a state of decay might need to be revitalised to move goods from where they were produced to the market.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The team at the level of DGs, Department of Water, DoT, the Department of Public Enterprises, Department of Science and Technology and Department of Postal Services and Telecommunication (in so far as broadband was concerned), had been asked to develop a cross-cutting plan in support of each one of the nine-point plans. &nbsp;He felt it was important to give a broad overview of the different role players.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The high level technical government structure of Directors General, heads of Departments of Agriculture and Rural Development in the provinces, and municipal managers met every month. At the last meeting, the state of readiness of each one of the districts had been assessed. This was where it had been determined who needed what assistance, and those who lacked technical capacity had indicated so. In fact, six provinces had requested the national Department to dispatch a team with technical expertise to help finalise planning, in order to be at the same level as the North West and the Free State. The Department was not saying by any means that its governance framework was enough. This was an uncharted territory which had never been embarked on. A number of mistakes might be made, but lessons would have to be learnt as the programme moved along. The Department would not wait for a perfect blueprint and a silver bullet for every problem encountered. Ways to resolve the problems would have to be found.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members were spot on about the cost. The programme would depend entirely on the fiscus, or the allocation of government funding. The DDG had shown an organogram which showed that the private sector would play a big role.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Shabane added that he had responded to the questions on alignment of structure, monitoring and evaluation. One of the things asked of all the provinces was for all three spheres of government to consult thoroughly amongst themselves. When all was said and done, the Department could not plan on behalf of the farmers. There should be a massive drive to start mobilising farmers. Each province was at different levels of farmer mobilisation. The Eastern Cape was far ahead in terms of talking to the farmers. However not all the sites were confirmed in the Eastern Cape, because government was proposing certain sites and the farmers were proposing different ones. This was the kind of consultation that was happening. In Limpopo, there was a data base of the farmers that had been engaged. Consultation with farmers was on-going.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Archary added that in terms of linkages to other structures, there was phase two and three of CRDP which dealt with enterprise development, village industry development and rural industrialisation. The Agri-Parks programme was not moving away from that and would obviously still be aligned to existing structures. The ones being talked about by the Department was really ensuring at the implementation level there were structures which supported the government framework of the RDP management system. It was really about strengthening that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The question about consultation had been answered by the DG. The Department was now going into detail farm by farm, making assessments of all of the areas surrounding the Agri-Parks. There were detailed plans coming from the provinces for consultations with farmers as well as traditional communities. At the provincial level, consultation had taken place between farmer organisations, different commodity sectors and so forth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She clarified that in the Western Cape, consultation was not finished. In other provinces, consultations had been done, and that was why the numbers were not adding up. There were still about three sites which still had to be confirmed, even in those Provinces where consultations had happened. In the Western Cape, provincial consultations were yet to be held, and were scheduled for 30 June. It was not that the province did not want to participate, but there was a need to understand that the Western Cape as a whole had come on late. Originally the 27 districts had not found their space in the Western Cape. It was not that the Western Cape did not want to participate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It had been indicated that by the end of next week the Department would be able to confirm the funding that would be available across all the sector departments. Indeed, R2 billion would not be sufficient to drive the programme to its desired level. The R 2billion only came from DRDLR, but there would also be money coming from all sector departments in the space. The Department acknowledged the lack of sufficient money and was working to ensure there were clear projections and clear cash flows for that funding. This was not a one-year budget allocation, it was a long term programme, at least over the next MTSF, and the R2 billion had been confirmed by DRDLR to go into the programme every year. The Department was expecting other departments to do similar kinds of things in terms of the work that they would be doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In response to how the Department came up with its particular model of an Agri-Park, Ms Archary said it had done a significant amount of research. It had looked at work that had been done in other countries, such as India, Brazil, Mexico, the Netherlands, Kenya, and some other areas in Africa. There were about seven or eight different countries that had been looked at before the Department had come up with the model. It had not just taken something that came from somewhere and applied it to the South African context. The Department had also looked at models that were being implemented by the provinces. Many provinces had what was being referred to as Agri Villages, Agri Hubs, the market areas created, the fresh produce market, etc., and tried to find a way to link all of them together in terms of the concept of the modelling that was now being put on the table. As indicated by the DG, the programme was indeed work where the Department would be learning as the programme moved along, and the model was not a fixed model, so that nothing else would be taken into consideration. It was not that the model would be found on the ground already. When the department said &ldquo;prototypical,&rdquo; it wanted to give guidance to provinces even as they were trying to do it. The work that had already been completed was a prototypical design of how an Agri-Park would look, with guidelines and criteria for evaluation in terms of the sites that had been chosen. A lot of work had already been done around the analysis in the last year, when the Department had worked with a team of experts from the DAFF in terms of determination of commodities, current infrastructure that existed in the area, what soil tests had already been done and what could be blown away. All this had been used to come up with the model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the Department had said the corporate structure of the Agri-Parks was farmer controlled, it meant the Department was at the moment busy working on packaging it. It was using the guideline of the 70-30 ratio, and it did not mean that the state would have to own that 30 percent. The idea was that the state would actually withdraw over time from this particular programme and it would be controlled by farmers and the private sector. One of the aims was to ensure private sector investment into that space, and into the hub itself. What was on the table right now was a broad guideline, and the Department had the next two weeks to finalise the way in which the corporate structure would actually work. The issues raised by Members of &ldquo;who&rdquo; and &ldquo;how&rdquo; was what the Department was trying to unpack so that a workable model was put down for the farmers, but also to bring in the necessary required investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The detailed costing of everything in terms of the buildings and infrastructure would be determined business plan by business plan. The Department was currently busy with full feasibility studies and business planning with each of the district municipalities. As indicated by the DG, where there was no technical capacity, the Department was making provisions for that technical capacity with the money that had already been allocated for that particular purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding the use of appropriate technology, Ms Archary reminded Members that during the presentation she had emphasised that the model would not be able to work if constant research, innovation and the use of new technology was not ensured. Sustainability would be built on the way in which new technology was used for improved production at the levels of the farmers themselves, but also improvement in the processing aspect. This was an idea around the Agri-Hub itself, and a component referred to as a demonstration farm had been included. There would be a research and development component at that level, and the department would be working with the DST and Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) to determine how this would unfold. The Department agreed there would be a need to bring in appropriate technology in each of those areas. Where there was no water, the Department would have to ensure that there was water, either by finding alternative ways of farming, or sources of water, and using new technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All sites had been identified in consultation with the district municipalities and the local municipalities. It was not the Department which had identified the sites. This had been done by the provinces during the consultation process. In Amathole, that was the process that had been followed. In Butterworth, the focus had been around the red meat industry, so the actual site was going to revolve around the Butterworth abattoir and expand outwards into the livestock production in the area. Even if a site had been identified, it still had to go against the testing that had now been put into place. A site was not chosen for the sake of being chosen, but had to meet the required criteria in terms of sustainability, otherwise the programme would become a white elephant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She apologised that it was not possible to put down every planning progress detail of every Province. The Department had a detailed schedule for each province, and these would be submitted to Members. As far as progress was concerned, the North West was far advanced at the moment. Production areas had already been identified. The Free State followed closely in terms of progress, and that was why the Department could give the Committee progress on every single site. It was hoped that by September, at the levels of production, everyone would have areas identified and funds would have been dispersed for the production element to begin. The work would run in parallel, to catch the current production season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Shabane added that the Department was busy setting up District Land Reform committees. The committees would be the primary drivers of the selection process of farmers. The farmers were smallholder farmers, and not community. Selection criteria had been set out and a category of people that were targeted had been identified. For instance, there were one million smallholder farmers who were farming in the former homelands, and these were some of the targeted farmers. The District Land Reform committees would be the instruments the state would use to select beneficiaries, and identify the land that was appropriate for that particular area to create jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of challenges, in as much as APAP and the NDP set a target of one million jobs, planning indicated the commodities that were the winners to create a certain number of jobs -- for instance, jobs per hectare per commodity in a particular area. Input costs had been deliberately singled out, and energy and water had been identified as challenges. Feed and fertiliser had also been identified as a challenge, as had hatcheries and nurseries. Therefore the APAP had to come up with ways to resolve this, as there were monopolies controlling those particular areas. There were monopolies controlling the fertiliser industry and entering the space was a challenge. The government, using levers such as policies and legislation, could break those monopolies so that people could have access to more affordable inputs, such as fertiliser and energy. Unless the monopolies around those areas were broken, the plans would not progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of expectation, the DG said he had met a number of farmers on Saturday. Some were keeping up to 1 000 chickens, others up to two million chickens. Some of them had asked questions about the budget, and had indicated it was too little. The Department was of the view that the industry could not be transformed through government grants. It would have to be very stringent in the selection criteria. Some people would be given grants, but if farmers wanted to operate at a different level and wanted to grow as farmers, they should be prepared to take some risks and bring equity to the table. The programme was not entirely driven through government handouts -- there was an equity element that had to come from the farmers. Government could not do it alone and the expectation that there would be stipends would not be met, as the Department could not give farmers stipends. The government could not put R2 billion on the table, provide land and have farmers still expecting a stipend from the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Mannya said that Agri-Parks should be seen as a strategic intervention to maximise the existing potential of certain initiatives by closing gaps and aggregating all the efforts to make the most of it. The smallholder farmer was the key target or beneficiary of the programme. It was expected that smallholder farmers would benefit the most from the programme, and the design was exactly meant for that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DAFF already had farmer support centres or agriculture extension officers in the provinces. The intention was to look at how support could be brought a step closer to the farmer support centres. It was possible that over time some offices would be moved to the farmer support centres.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of poultry in Lebowakgomo, the abattoir was developed and capacity had been increased to slaughtering 20 000 birds a day. Broiler poultry houses had been developed around the abattoir to supply the abattoir. Unfortunately, the abattoir had not been brought into operation, but the situation had already been corrected to find an operator. The operator would ensure that the broiler houses to supply the abattoirs were activated.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of research capacity, there was some indication of what the DAFF, Department of Science and Technology, and the Agricultural Research Council was doing to build that capacity over time. There were a number of partnerships, including international partnerships, to grow capacity and bring young scientists into various programmes to reach that capacity before losing the senior scientists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The training provided within the agricultural education training strategy was intended to ensure that the training provided was accredited training. Figures had been provided in one of the tables, but the intention was to add to the existing number of training institutes of agriculture training centres, including the colleges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Mannya said that on the whole, the Department had read capability maps and in some cases suitability maps. Therefore as the sites were being selected, land capability and suitability would be taken into consideration. For various specific sites where production happened, soil tests would be undertaken. However it would be already known that in that area, in terms of agro-ecology, the land would be suitable for particular commodities. There were maps available for the identified commodities in Agri-Parks for each province in terms of what was suitable for what.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of the catchment guidelines being based on kilometres, they were actually based on the density of farmers within a particular space. The kilometre was a guideline, but the main focus was around the density.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Incorporation of all current types of projects, whether land acquisition or restitution, the idea was that the Department would be working in terms of ensuring that the existing projects also began to produce at the correct level. The projects would begin to support the processing component of the AgriParks. It was about bringing into production the communal areas, current land reform farmers and traditional communities within that economic area, as well as the inclusion of private sector farmers in the agro-processing part of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson thanked the departments for the responses. She said there was an outstanding question on the composition of the Multi-Disciplinary Committee, and also the role of the Department of Environmental Affairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Archary responded that the DG had explained the Multi-Disciplinary Committee special task team composition in terms of all the different DGs. When sending the other information, the Department would also send the information of details in terms of the composition. The Department of Environment was also part of that task team, both in the&nbsp;Multi-Disciplinary Task Team and also at the cluster level. The Department would not be able to move in respect of all the environmental regulations that had to be dealt with, and the Department of Environmental Affairs was a critical partner in that particular process for the environmental impact assessments (EIAs) and all other environmental issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Mannya said that in the NDP there was an indication that the new areas under irrigation could be increased. Before this could happen, water had to be released in addition to the newly revitalised land that had been developed. The revitalised irrigation schemes were being taken into consideration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The investment in the Lebowakgomo project, which included the broiler and the abattoir, was in the vicinity of R6 million in respect of the houses that would be developed with the revitalisation of the abattoirs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms M Semenya (ANC), Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, said the presentations from the two departments should be welcomed as a work-in-progress. This should not be the end of the interaction as a joint Committee. Another meeting should be held to follow up on the many questions, some of which had been raised by Members on the agricultural side, that referred to challenges that could affect the Agri-Parks if not addressed. Agriculture revitalisation and value chain adding was part of the nine plans, and Cabinet had approved the Agriculture Action Policy Plan which guided how agriculture would be revitalised throughout the country. The DRDLR had come up with a rural economic boost in the rural areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Department&#39;s role should be on how to deal with the shortcomings of not having Animal Health practitioners. To succeed in red meat, veterinarians were needed to lead the Animal Health practitioners. As agriculture was being revitalised, the question would be how the Department would close the gap in human resources, as scientists were being lost. Practitioners were ageing, but there was no evident recruitment happening. This particular aspect was not clear, even in the DAFF&#39;s action plan. She suggested the Committees should have another meeting and follow up as Members went to their respective constituencies to visit the sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She advised the DG that as the programme had been presented to Cabinet and adopted, if provinces and municipalities did not adopt the programme as provincial and municipal programmes, there would be problems. Consultations should lead to provinces and municipalities adopting the programme so there would not be problems in implementation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Mcebisi Skwatsha Deputy Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform thanked the Chairperson. He said the comments made were highly appreciated. The national office could only set up the criteria to implement the plan. The Department would continue to work on the comments made. The ideas of the Department could not be fruitful without mass support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson said the Parliamentary session was for five years, and the Department would be submitting quarterly reports. If there was a need to call the Department it was the Committee&#39;s right to do so. It was not possible to exhaust all the issues in one day, and she asked Members to hold on to the issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Committee Secretary informed members that the oversight plans for July 2015 had been approved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson concluded by saying that the project would be good if the plans were implemented effectively. The lives of smallholder farmers and the communities where the parks would be situated would be changed. Members had been informed about the role of the DAFF and DRDLR, as they were working jointly to ensure that the Agri-Parks were established and operational. It was the Committee&#39;s responsibility to do oversight of the plans that had been presented, to monitor their implementation. Members had made proposals on some issues, and she asked if the Department could take some of them into consideration and see if they could assist in improving the implementation of the Agri-Parks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Committee would continue having joint meetings with other departments and other Portfolio Committees because there were overlapping issues, like water and electricity, amongst others. This would not be the last meeting. If there was a need, perhaps the Committee could spend one or two days to deal with Agri-Parks. A detailed progress report on each and every province was expected. The consultations should continue and be finalised so that the programme could proceed with other processes to ensure that by the end of the 2015/2016 financial year, at least one or two Agri-Parks would be established and functional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Consideration of minutes of 17 June 2015</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Filtane proposed adoption of the minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Madella seconded the adoption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The meeting was adjourned.</p>\r\n",

        "summary": "<p>The Department of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) and the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform (DRDLR) jointly presented on the implementation of the One District, One Agri-Park programme in the context of the framework of the rural economic transformation model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DAFF&rsquo;s presentation focused on its role in the revitalisation of agriculture and the agro-processing value chain in the Agri-Parks programme, which would be contributing to the priorities outlined in the State of Nation Address in trying to ensure growth in the agricultural sector. The intention to grow the sector would focus primarily on ensuring that there was growth in the agro-processing part, growth in the sector as a whole, and also on growing jobs. The key challenges were high input costs, particularly in animal feed, competing interests for land, anti-competitive behaviour which resulted from market dominance, climate change in the form of droughts, floods, and fires, and the degradation of soil as a whole, which affected productivity. Agri-Parks had been proposed as one of the interventions to ensure growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DAFF&rsquo;s role in the Agri-Parks was largely around provision of services, which ranged from consumer support, capacity building, extension support and support to market access. In comparison with other countries, South Africa provided the lowest support to producers. This was not good for growth and it was one of the major areas&nbsp;that had to be worked on, otherwise all other efforts would become useless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A number of value chains had been identified in poultry and red meat production, fruits, fresh produce, sugar and wine. Technology development and innovation was necessary for inroads to be made and structures developed. The agenda of research, innovation and technology development had to be enhanced, otherwise it would not be possible to improve the situation. There was also a need to increase the current human resource capacity and expertise, which was limited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DRDLR&rsquo;s said the concept of Agri-Parks drew from existing models in the country, as well as the rest of the world. These included educational farms, experimental farms, collective farming, farm incubation projects, agri-clusters, eco villages, urban-edge allotments and market gardens. The proposed model would make use of both public and private land and would serve as a transition zone between urban and agricultural land uses. Agri-Parks would evoke a traditional model of an agricultural business park or hub, where multiple tenants and owners operated under a common management structure. They would provide networks of contacts between producers&rsquo; markets and processors, as well as the physical infrastructure required for transforming the industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Agri-Parks would be farmer-controlled and the Department was currently working on defining how farmer-control would occur. The model would have a strong social mobilisation component so that black farmers and agri-business entrepreneurs were mobilised and organised to support this particular initiative. It was intended to have various activities around processing by adding other services around social services, retail services and so forth. There would be linkages with surrounding municipalities and villages to ensure that production elements and other activities were localised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The strategic objectives of the Agri-Parks were the establishment of the parks in all districts of the country. They would promote growth of the smallholder sector by contributing to the 300 000 new small-scale producers, as well as 145 000 new jobs in agro-processing by 2020. The Agri-Parks would be an innovation system of agro-production, processing, logistics, marketing, and training and extension services. There would be three components, the first component being the Farmer Production Support Unit (FPSU) which would have a rural outreach unit connected with the Agri-Hub itself. The FPSU would do primary collection, some storage, some processing for the local market and extension services, including mechanisation. The second component was the Agri-Hub Unit, which was where key processing would happen. The unit would also carry out packaging, logistics and training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DRDLR had already committed R2 billion for the current financial year which would be used in all of the 44 districts to roll out the Agri-Parks. The money would be used differently by the provinces, depending on the phases of the project as they emerged in terms of the business plans per district. Some of the money would be utilised for infrastructure and others on the production element. This would be crucial if the programme was to become a success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members were concerned that the R2 billion set aside for the programme was insufficient. They were also concerned with the criteria used to identify farmers for participation in the Agri-Parks. The DAFF was asked about what it was doing to ensure that there was human capacity to replace the ageing research and development scientists who were close to retirement, but whose skills were not being transferred to their potential successors.</p>\r\n",

Committee meetings are open to the public, but may be closed if there is a good reason to do so.<br/> <br/> <strong>The different committees have one or more of the following functions:</strong></p> They monitor and oversee the work and budgets of national government departments and hold them accountable They consider and amend Bills, and may initiate Bills They consider private members' and provincial legislative proposals and special petitions They consider international treaties and agreements They examine specifi c areas of public life or matters of public interest They take care of domestic parliamentary issues Committees have the power to summon any person to appear before them, give evidence or produce documents. They may require any person or institution to report to them. Committees may also receive petitions, representations or submissions from the public. Each Committee is headed by a Chairperson. <p><br/> <strong>THE DIFFERENT COMMITTEES OF PARLIAMENT</strong><br/> <br/> <strong>Portfolio Committees</strong><br/> The National Assembly (NA) appoints from among its members a number of Portfolio Committees to shadow the work of the various national government departments.</p> <p><br/> <strong>The role of Portfolio Committees is to:</strong></p> consider Bills, deal with departmental budget votes, oversee the work of the department they are responsible for, and enquire and make recommendations about any aspect of the department, including its structure, functioning and policy. <p><br/> The work of Committees is not restricted to government. They may investigate any matter of public interest that falls within their area of responsibility. There is a Portfolio Committee for each national Ministry and its associated government department/s.<br/> <br/> <strong>Select Committees</strong><br/> The National Council of Provinces (NCOP) appoints from its permanent members a number of Select Committees to shadow the work of the various national government departments and to deal with Bills.<br/> <br/> Because only 54 of the 90 NCOP Members are permanent delegates compared to the 400 of the NA, the Select Committees oversee the work of more than one national government department.<br/> <br/> <strong>Public Accounts Committees</strong><br/> The National Assembly Standing Committee on Public Accounts acts as Parliament's watchdog over the way taxpayers' money is spent by the Executive. Every year the Auditor-General tables reports on the accounts and financial management of the various government departments and State institutions.<br/> <br/> Heads of government departments and institutions are regularly called by this committee to report and account for expenditure. The Committee can recommend that the National Assembly takes corrective actions if necessary.<br/> <br/> <strong>Members' Legislative Proposals and Petitions Committees</strong><br/> Draft bills can be submitted by individual Members of the National Assembly. These bills are considered by the National Assembly's Standing Committee on Private Member's Legislative Proposals and Special Petitions. If the Committee agrees with the principle of the draft Bill, a Bill will be prepared and dealt with by Parliament.<br/> <br/> The National Council of Provinces Select Committee on Members' and Provincial Legislative Proposals considers draft Bills from individual NCOP members and provincial legislatures.<br/> <br/> Petitions may also be tabled in Parliament and referred to the relevant committee that deals with the issue raised in the petition.<br/> <br/> <strong>Internal Committees</strong><br/> The National Assembly has a number of internal committees that deal with matters affecting the running of Parliament. The Committees normally consist of senior Members of Parliament. The Rules Committee and its sub-committees deal with House rules, the budget of the House, support for Members, internal arrangements, and powers and privileges of members. Other internal Committees are the Programme Committee that plans the work of the Assembly, the Disciplinary Committee, and the Committee of Chairpersons.<br/> <br/> The National Council of Provinces has its own domestic Committees. The Rules Committee and its subcommittees deal with the NCOP rules, the NCOP budget, parliamentary privileges, internal arrangements, international relations and delegated legislation. The Programme Committee plans the work of the NCOP and the Committee of Chairpersons make recommendations about the functioning of Committees and other NCOP forums.<br/> <br/> <strong>Ad hoc Committees</strong><br/> Parliament or one of its Houses may appoint an ad hoc (temporary) Committee when a special task must be done. When the task is complete, the Committee is dissolved.<br/> <br/> <strong>Joint Committees</strong><br/> The National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces together appoint a number of joint committees, for example the Constitutional Review Committee.<br/> <br/> The Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and the Joint Standing Committee on Defence are statutory Committees. This means that they are established, by the Constitution or by an Act of Parliament, as well as in terms of the rules of Parliament.<br/> <br/> The committees play a very important role in the process of building democracy and involving the public in the processes and activities of Parliament.</p> ",

        "body": "<p><strong>Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries introductory remarks</strong><br />\r\nGen Bheki Cele stated that transformation in the forest sector is zero. There are those who are willing to push for transformation in this sector and those who are resisting it. He said his Department would through all available means try to push for transformation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe indicated that for a long time the Forestry branch of the Department has been an orphan. It was brought to the Department in 2009. Forestry has been given to the Deputy Minister because the Presidential instructions indicated that the Minister and Deputy Minister should share the responsibilities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe informed the Committee that the potential for growth in this sector is huge. The major problem is in water licensing and availability of land. Land claims are causing uncertainty in the industry because some forests are on lands that are being claimed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Deputy Minister reported that recently the Department invited Grade 11 and 12 learners including undergraduate and PhD students to a workshop to encourage them to follow a career path in forestry.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) presentation on Forestry</strong><br />\r\nDr Mmaphaka Tau, Deputy Director-General: Forestry and Natural Resources Management, DAFF, informed the Committee that forest coverage in South Africa is quite minimal compared to other countries but the output is high when compared with other land use types. In 2012 the sector created 165 300 jobs across the value chain. The forest products industry ranks among the top exporting industries in the country and this means it is maintaining a positive trade balance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe forestry sector is a major contributor to the South African economy through its well developed and diversified forest products industry. According to Forestry South Africa, forestry currently contributes 25, 5% to agriculture Gross Domestic Product (2013). The Forestry sector supports manufacturing sub-sectors such as saw-milling, paper and pulp production, mining and construction.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDAFF manages 60 200 hectares of planted plantations. Of the total land area 122,3 ha, only 1% is used for forestry plantations. The area of land under plantation has declined from 1, 5 million ha in 1997/98 to 1, 2 million ha in 2012/13. DAFF is involved with Forestry Enterprise Development (FED) by supplying technical and marketing assistance to small growers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince 2014, DAFF is investigating the role of Agro-Forestry in local household food security. The Department is working towards certification of three plantations by 2018 with the first one in 2016. The plantations are Hlokozi in KwaZulu-natal, Katberg in the Eastern Cape and Voorspoed in Limpopo.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith regard to indigenous forests and woodlands, Dr Tau indicated that DAFF manages about 189 696 ha of indigenous forests across the country. Indigenous forests cover about 492 700 ha. Woodlands cover between 29 and 39 mil hectares. The main role of DAFF is conservation planning and compliance promotion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbout 80% of rural household use fuel wood as their primary source of energy. About 28 million people use traditional plant medicine. Approximately 1/3 of medicinal plant material is tree bark. The rural poor are more dependent on forest resources for survival.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Tau noted that the Forestry sector is facing several challenges which revolve around:<br />\r\n- low afforestation rate due to cumbersome licensing processes<br />\r\n- under-investment in long-rotation timber such as saw-logs<br />\r\n- risks associated with climate change and variability manifesting through fires, pests and diseases<br />\r\n- slow pace of transformation since the gazetting of the Transformation Charter<br />\r\n- climate change that results in varying temperatures and unreliable rainfall<br />\r\n- heavy dependence of rural communities who live adjacent to forests is putting pressure on indigenous forests and woodlands.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConcerning policy and legislative framework, he highlighted that the White Paper on Sustainable Forest Development states that the government should withdraw from direct management of state plantations. It states that the state should reposition itself as a forestry sector leader and regulator.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the White Paper highlights the role of the state as a regulator, the National Development Plan provides space for it to being an enabler for economic growth, rural development and employment creation. Forestry interventions such as afforestation and rehabilitation of plantations feature in the agricultural policy action plan and seek to address economic development and job creation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Department has gazetted the Preservation and Development of Agricultural Land Framework (PDALF) and Forestry Laws Amendment Bills in order to enhance forestry and natural resources management. The purpose of the PDALF is to efficiently and effectively preserve and develop agricultural land to ensure sustainable long-term food security and job creation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChallenges related to the management of State forests are as follows:<br />\r\n- ageing and fragile workforce<br />\r\n- deteriorating working and living conditions<br />\r\n- budget limitations for operations<br />\r\n- ageing infrastructure<br />\r\n- illegal clearing of forests and trees<br />\r\n- afforestation licences take a long time before they are issued.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Tau indicated that the process of finalising land claims takes a long time and this has unintended consequences because communities end up not receiving the rental money they are entitled to and end up being in conflict with the company that is operating state forest land. This results in the increase in the number of fires in the plantations and poses a risk to the investment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn transformation, the Department is in the process of transferring the Mbazwana State plantations to the Mabaso, Mbila and Manzengwenya communities. The transfer is at an advanced stage. DAFF has assisted with the application for funding from the Jobs Fund. The Department is contributing towards the &lsquo;own contribution&rsquo; required from applicants by the Jobs Fund. The leasing of the Category A plantations has resulted in the accumulation of lease rental money that the Department has kept in a public investment account.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDAFF has established the Kabelo Land and Restitution Trust that is responsible for the collection, investment and disbursement of rental money to the rightful land reform beneficiaries. The first disbursement of R86, 4 million was given to eight communities in the Eastern Cape during 2011.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRegarding support to community plantations, DAFF has developed the afforestation strategy in order to support new entrants and participants in the market. The strategy is aimed at addressing the expansion of forestry plantations in order to address the demands of the country for timber. The support is focused on two areas:<br />\r\n- growers needing support to establish plantations (afforestation)<br />\r\n- existing growers (Post Settlement Support).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOther issues faced by communities and individuals include affordability to pay for the costly Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). To address these challenges, DAFF conducted studies to assess the afforestation potential in the whole country.&nbsp; After the afforestation studies were concluded, DAFF funded the EIAs for the Eastern Cape for an area of 13000 ha. This resulted in Records of Decision issued for an area of 10 500 ha. A sum of R4, 2 million was spent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the current financial year, DAFF would fund and conduct EIAs in KwaZulu-Natal for an area of 5000 ha. Once the Records of Decision are issued, this would pave the way for afforestation licences and subsequent plantings.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn water licensing and water rights, the Department has established an Intergovernmental Committee to deal with water licensing. Currently, the Committee comprises DAFF, Departments of Water and Sanitation, Trade and Industry, the Forestry Industry and Industrial Development Corporation as a development finance institution. When the need arises, other crucial Departments like Rural Development and Land Reform are invited to the Committee to deal with community resolutions and other land related matters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbout the resolution of land claims on state forest land, DAFF has established the Kabelo Land and Restitution Trust that is responsible for the collection, investment and disbursement of rental money to the rightful land reform beneficiaries. The rental money is currently invested in the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) with a balance of R304 168 493 (30 March 2015). The resolution of land claims is the responsibility of the Regional Land Claims Commissioner (RLCC). DAFF is having quarterly engagements with the RLCC to track down progress on forestry land claims and to assist with information where necessary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Department has made strategic interventions on a number of issues. It has facilitated afforestation licences by paying for the costly EIAs. It would engage in the following initiatives with the Departments of Health, Human Settlement, Education, Safety and Security, Labour and Water and Sanitation in order to resolve the health, housing and sanitation conditions of Forestry workers. DAFF has met with the Department of Water and Sanitation regarding measures to avoid the lengthy period that it takes to issue afforestation licences and the exemption of small growers from paying water tariffs in the years of establishment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn his conclusion, Dr Tau stated that the Department, through the National Afforestation Technical Task Team, has requested the Department of Water and Sanitation to set standards for the time required to process a licence. Through the Task Team of the Forest Sector Transformation Charter, DAFF is exploring options to establish funding mechanisms for small growers and other small producers in the Forestry sector. Lastly, DAFF would continue to engage with the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform and the Land Claims Commission to streamline the finalisation of outstanding land claims.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Forest Sector Charter Council (FSCC): BBBEE Progress Report </strong><br />\r\nMr Simangaliso Mkhwanazi, Executive Director: Forest Sector Charter Council, provided information on the progress and performance towards the implementation of Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) in the Forestry sector and outlined the challenges faced in the implementation of B-BBEE in this sector and related industries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe main objective of the Forest Sector Charter is to extend the economic opportunities and benefits of the Forest sector to the previously disadvantaged Black groups. It targets growers and the fibre, saw-milling, pole and charcoal industries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe FSCC participates in government, industry and council forums and is a member of the Joint Technical Team, an initiative of the Department of Trade and Industry. Its main responsibilities are to facilitate, oversee and encourage the implementation of the Charter; monitor and report on the Charter undertakings; monitor and report on the transformation status; and to publicise the Charter. It holds four quarterly meetings a year.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe FSCC reports to the B-BBEE Advisory Council of the President, Minister of Trade and Industry and Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. The objective of the B-BBEE status report is to assess the status of transformation in the Forest sector. The scorecard has seven elements: Ownership, Management Control, Employment Equity, Skills Development, Preferential Procurement, Enterprise Development and Socio-Economic Development. Measured entities are:<br />\r\n- Medium and Large Enterprises (MLE)<br />\r\n- Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSE)<br />\r\n- Exempted Micro Enterprises (EME).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Fifth Transformation status report has been completed. Gathered information has been analysed. The analysis is based on the size of the enterprise. The sector achieved a Level Four status (a level increase from previous year, Level 5). Four of the seven scorecard elements recorded an improvement: Ownership (61%), Employment Equity (40%), Skills Development (51%) and Enterprise Development (98%). The Management Control and Employment Equity are struggling to move beyond the 50% target. There is consistent and excellent performance in Enterprise Development (98%), Preferential Procurement (77%) and Socio-Economic Development (156%) but there is a limited representation of black women in director and executive positions of companies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQualifying Small Enterprises have achieved 80% of target except in Skills Development. The QSEs have maintained Level 3 status. EMEs have maintained Level 4 status (65% of EMEs are White-managed).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn challenges facing the B-BBEE transformation status, the verification process that is using the generic scorecard needs to be addressed through the Joint Technical Committee of the dti and New Codes. All enterprises falling within a sector that has sector code must be verified under that Sector Code. The database is inaccurate and this would be addressed through organised sub-sector associations and updating the database.<br />\r\nAn intensified awareness programme is to be undertaken. Entities without B-BBEE certificates would be addressed through the New Codes, and all enterprises falling within a sector that has a sector code must be verified under a Sector Code.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n(Graphs were shown to illustrate the B-BBEE transformation status in the performance of the seven elements of the scorecard)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn his concluding remarks, Mr Mkhwanazi indicated that the number of reporting entities has improved from 26 in 2010 to 77 in 2014. Ownership in the sector is achieving an average performance. The sector is performing well in Enterprise Development, Socio-Economic Development and Preferential Procurement though the sector specific guidelines still need to be developed. More improvement is required in Employment Equity and Management Control. More efforts are to be channelled to under-represented sub-sectors, QSEs and EMEs, through better enforcement measures. The delivery on industry and government undertakings is necessary to enhance transformation in the Forest sector. Lastly, the mandate of the Council would be strengthened through actual visits to enterprises, monitoring and audits.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><em>Discussion</em></strong><br />\r\nThe Chairperson remarked she did not hear the presentation mention &lsquo;radical transformation&rsquo; as had been called for by the Deputy Minister through the media.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Deputy Director-General, Dr Tau, replied that the Radical Transformation Programme would be discussed in the next meeting when the Department is going to have a meeting with the Committee and it would provide the baseline. He, however, pointed out that forestry does contribute to socio-economic transformation. The Department is busy fast-tracking water licensing and implementing the Forest Charter. The Forestry Sector Value Chain Roundtable has been established to fast-track all outstanding issues raises in the Industrial Policy Action Plan&nbsp; (IPAP).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs A Steyn remarked that DAFF was presenting to the Committee 2012 job creation figures and she could not understand why DAFF was not presenting new statistics. She stated that the forestry sector is in decline and it was pointless to transform a sector that is dying. She asked if the Department has any plans to grow the sector. She wanted to know why the certification of plantation and water licensing processes were cumbersome.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Tau replied, regarding the decline of the sector, that this requires support from all stakeholders so that the goals of Forestry can be achieved. He agreed that the reduction in plantations was affecting job creation. For each plantation that takes place, many jobs get created. Concerning cumbersome processes of plantation certification and water licensing, he reported that certification applies to an existing forest and looks at things like viability while afforestation licensing applies to where you want to plant and it has to go through the Departments of Water and Sanitation and Rural Development and Land Reform.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Z Jongbloed (DA) asked how long does the cumbersome afforestation licensing process takes; and what the agro-forestry investigation was about.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn how long it takes to process water licences, Dr Tau reported that there have been backlogs. Now the responsibilities of processing the licences have been given to a more senior director. It is hoped this move is going to speed up the process. The agro-forestry investigation is to be done during the course of this year and DAFF is busy finalising the appointment of a service provider who would be conducting the investigation. DAFF is investigating the role of agro-forestry in local household food security.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr L Ntshayisa (AIC) wanted to know why the ageing workforce in the Forestry sector could not be granted pension so that the youthful ones can take over. He asked if DAFF had any plans in place to address skills development because he does not see any skills development programmes in rural areas, especially where forestry is happening.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA Department official replied about the ailing workforce, pointing out that forestry is labour intensive. The conditions they work under is taking a toll on them, and the human resources division is assisting with the implementation of the policy on ill-health.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Tau added that 54 undergraduate and graduate students are being funded for forestry studies. There are also learnership programmes that are being undertaken with the Sector Education and Training Authorities (SETAs). This is done in the name of addressing the ageing workforce.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Mkhwanazi, replying to the question on skills development, reported that the previous codes did not provide targets. Now that the new codes have set targets, the enterprises would have to meet them. If they do not, they get discounted and get lower points. The previous targets did not provide the Council with the teeth to make sure the enterprises were complying and meeting targets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Tau added that the locals maintain the plantation, but if a skilled person is hard to find internally, an outsider is employed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Z Mandela (ANC) wanted to know if the 100 000 ha which came out of the afforestation studies for the Eastern Cape is going to be on until the end of the Fifth Parliament.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Tau replied that a certain number of hectares have been planted in the Umzimkhulu area and they include some parts of KwaZulu-Natal like Singisi.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr M Filtane (UDM) remarked that the Eastern Cape 100 000 ha is an old story he has heard of many years ago. It does not look like it is going to change. He asked how much do our forests provide for traditional medicine. He asked why the government is taking its time to pay people the rental money and why there is no provision for funding when forestry is contributing so much to GDP.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Tau replied that traditional medicine contributes much to the GDP. The Department has learnt that most medicines are made from forest products. Cellulose is one example of a medicine produced from forest products. With regard to the rental money, he explained that it is difficult to pay the money if the land claim is not finalised. Money should be given to the rightful owner to avoid unnecessary wars. That is why the Department has established the Rental Disbursement Model. It pays the money when the Department has approved the business plans of the operating company.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr T Ramokhoase (ANC) asked if the 20 000 small growers that have been helped are individuals or groups. He asked the Department to clarify the 70-year contract given to companies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Makhosazana Mavimbela, Researcher: Forest Sector Charter Council, reported that support was given to individuals because people cannot be allowed not to plant. They got assisted technically, not financially.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Tau replied that the 70-year contract was given to companies to give them a chance to harvest twice and replant.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr C Maxhegwana (ANC) asked the Department to elaborate on the funding framework regarding MAFISA.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA member of the Department indicated that MAFISA is a loan not a grant. The funding mechanism of the department does not include forestry but the matter is being reviewed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn asked who looks after trust funds for communities and who does the Department answer to regarding these funds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDeputy Minister, Gen Bheki Cele, reported that the money is invested with the Public Investment Corporation (PIC). It is a public entity. He advised the Committee to engage with it. He indicated there were communities that were given the money but that was not done properly. Money was given to individuals. Now the focus is going to be on community development programmes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Adoption of Minutes</strong><br />\r\nMinutes of the 2, 5 and 9 June 2015 committee meetings were adopted.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMeeting was adjourned.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "summary": "<p>In his introductory remarks, the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries stated that transformation in the forest sector is zero. There are those who are willing to push for transformation in this sector and those who are resisting it. He said his Department would through all available means push for transformation. The potential for growth in this sector is huge. The major problem is in water licensing and availability of land as land claims are causing uncertainty in the industry.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Department stated that the forestry sector is a major contributor to the South African economy through its well developed and diversified forest products industry. According to Forestry South Africa, currently, forestry contributes 25, 5% to agriculture Gross Domestic Product (2013).&nbsp; Forestry supports manufacturing sub-sectors such as saw-milling, paper and pulp production, mining and construction.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDAFF informed the Committee that forest coverage in South Africa is quite minimal compared to other countries but the output is high when compared with other land use types. In 2012 the sector created 165 300 jobs across the value chain. The forest products industry ranks among the top exporting industries in the country and this means it is maintaining a positive trade balance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Department has made strategic interventions on a number of issues. It has facilitated afforestation licences by paying for the costly Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs). It would engage in the following initiatives with the Department of Health, Human Settlement, Education, Safety and security, Labour and Water and Sanitation in order to resolve the conditions, health, housing and sanitation issues of Forestry workers. DAFF has met with the Department of Water and Sanitation regarding measures to avoid the lengthy period that it takes to issue afforestation licences and the exemption of small growers from paying water tariffs in the years of establishment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Forest Sector Charter Council (FSCC) briefed the Committee about progress and performance towards the implementation of Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) in the Forestry sector and also noted the challenges in the implementation of B-BBEE in this sector and related industries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe main objective of the Forest Sector Charter is to extend the economic opportunities and benefits of the Forest sector to the previously disadvantaged black groups. It targets growers and the fibre, saw-milling, pole and charcoal industries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn challenges facing the B-BBEE transformation status, the FSCC reported that the verification process that is using the generic scorecard would be addressed through the Joint Technical Committee of the Department of Trade and Industry and New Codes. All enterprises falling within a sector that has a sector code must be verified under that Sector Code. The database is inaccurate and this would be addressed through organised sub-sector associations and updated database.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe FSCC indicated that the number of reporting entities has improved from 26 in 2010 to 77 in 2014. Ownership in the sector is achieving an average performance. The sector is performing well in Enterprise Development, Socio-Economic Development and Preferential Procurement though the sector specific guidelines still need to be developed. More improvement is required in Employment Equity and Management Control. The delivery on industry and government undertakings is necessary to enhance transformation in the Forest sector. Lastly, the mandate of the Council needs to strengthened through actual visits to enterprises, monitoring and audits.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMembers remarked they did not hear the mention of &lsquo;radical transformation&rsquo; in the presentation; that the forestry sector is in decline and it was pointless to transform a sector that is dying; that DAFF was presenting to the Committee 2012 job creation figures so why was DAFF not presenting new statistics. They asked why certification of plantation and water licensing processes were cumbersome; what the agro-forestry investigation was about; why the ageing workforce could not be granted pensions so youthful employees can take over; if DAFF had plans to address skills development as this was missing in rural areas, especially in forestry; and how much do our forests provide for traditional medicine.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

They may investigate any matter of public interest that falls within their area of responsibility. There is a Portfolio Committee for each national Ministry and its associated government department/s.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Select Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Council of Provinces (NCOP) appoints from its permanent members a number of Select Committees to shadow the work of the various national government departments and to deal with Bills.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause only 54 of the 90 NCOP Members are permanent delegates compared to the 400 of the NA, the Select Committees oversee the work of more than one national government department.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Public Accounts Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Assembly Standing Committee on Public Accounts acts as Parliament&#39;s watchdog over the way taxpayers&#39; money is spent by the Executive. Every year the Auditor-General tables reports on the accounts and financial management of the various government departments and State institutions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHeads of government departments and institutions are regularly called by this committee to report and account for expenditure. The Committee can recommend that the National Assembly takes corrective actions if necessary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Members&#39; Legislative Proposals and Petitions Committees</strong><br />\r\nDraft bills can be submitted by individual Members of the National Assembly. These bills are considered by the National Assembly&#39;s Standing Committee on Private Member&#39;s Legislative Proposals and Special Petitions. If the Committee agrees with the principle of the draft Bill, a Bill will be prepared and dealt with by Parliament.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe National Council of Provinces Select Committee on Members&#39; and Provincial Legislative Proposals considers draft Bills from individual NCOP members and provincial legislatures.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPetitions may also be tabled in Parliament and referred to the relevant committee that deals with the issue raised in the petition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Internal Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Assembly has a number of internal committees that deal with matters affecting the running of Parliament. The Committees normally consist of senior Members of Parliament. The Rules Committee and its sub-committees deal with House rules, the budget of the House, support for Members, internal arrangements, and powers and privileges of members. Other internal Committees are the Programme Committee that plans the work of the Assembly, the Disciplinary Committee, and the Committee of Chairpersons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe National Council of Provinces has its own domestic Committees. The Rules Committee and its subcommittees deal with the NCOP rules, the NCOP budget, parliamentary privileges, internal arrangements, international relations and delegated legislation. The Programme Committee plans the work of the NCOP and the Committee of Chairpersons make recommendations about the functioning of Committees and other NCOP forums.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Ad hoc Committees</strong><br />\r\nParliament or one of its Houses may appoint an ad hoc (temporary) Committee when a special task must be done.

She said that it was their Parliamentary &ldquo;bomama&rdquo; (mother). She welcomed all the Members of Parliament, and gave a proposal of the day&rsquo;s events, as contained in the programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Commission for Gender Equality on SADC Protocol on Gender and Development post-2015 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Fundisile Nzimande, Commissioner: Commission for Gender Equality (CGE) said that as a chapter 9 institution, the CGE participated in a number of activities in several domestic, regional and international for a in pursuit of driving the gender agenda. 2015 was also the year that the member states to the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Protocol had committed to achieving the 28 substantive targets for achieving gender equality. At the Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in September 2010 they had realised that there had been a significant failure in achieving the MDGs, but they had not ignored the achievements made, especially in poverty reduction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Nzimande elaborated on the origins of the SADC Protocol on Gender and Development, which had been signed at the SADC Heads of State Summit held on 16 and 17 August 2008 in Johannesburg. The Protocol had set 28 progressive targets which were to be achieved by 2015. Among the targets, the major ones were that women would hold 50% of the decision-making positions in the private and public sector, and there would be revision, amendments and repeal by 2015 of all sex or gender discriminatory laws by 2015. Other targets were ensuring equal participation of women and men in economic policy formulation and their implementation by 2015, as well as the adoption of an integrated approach to reduce gender based violence by half by 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The aim of the SADC Protocol on Gender and Development was to empower women socially, economically and politically to eliminate discrimination, to achieve gender equality through gender responsive legislation, policies and projects. The protocol among other things catered for education, health and conflict resolution. The SADC Ministers for Gender and Women Affairs had met on 2 June 2011. Of the 13 countries that had signed the Declaration in 2008, only seven had endorsed and ratified the Protocol with the SADC Secretariat. South Africa was one of those that had not ratified, even though they had played the leading role in the crafting of the Protocol. South Africa had ratified the Protocol only in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Nzimande then spoke about the SADC Protocol thematic areas. The Protocol had three measurable targets for constitutional and legal Rights. These included endeavouring to enshrine gender equality and equity in constitutions and ensure that these were not compromised by provisions, by law and practices. The target also included reviewing, amending and/or repealing all discriminatory laws, as well as abolishing the minority status of women. The second target aimed at participation and representation in government. South Africa had ratified the SADC Protocol in 2012, but the issue of inclusion of women had been on the agenda since the beginning of the democratic dispensation and was supported by a section of the constitution of South Africa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>South Africa had success stories in terms of putting in place policies and legislative frameworks to ensure gender transformation in relation to the provisions of the SADC Protocol. The Independent Electoral Act showed that the outcomes of the 2014 elections had been characterised by an overall drop in the representation of women as elected public representatives, from 43% to 39.7%. The Employment Equity Act 55 of 1998 had been instituted to promote equity in the work place, and the Promotion of Empowerment and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act 4 of 2000 (PEPUDA) aimed to prevent discriminatory attitudes and promoting norms of decision-making. The Minister of Public Service and Administration had launched the Heads of Departments&rsquo; (HODs) Eight Principles Action Plan for Women Empowerment and Gender Equality in 2007, and the same principles had been institutionalised in 2008 for implementation by government departments. If implemented, the action plan would ensure that the public service achieved progress towards equity in the workplace. The Department of Public Service and Administration (DPSA) had also developed guidelines for the implementation of the Employment Equity Act to assist departments in its implementation by ensuring that equity targets for women and people with disabilities were established and implemented through the recruitment strategies of the departments. The programmes were the Foundation Management Development Programme (FMDP), Emerging Management Development Programme (EMDP) and Advanced Management Development Programme (AMDP).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Nzimande said that South Africa had made progress on the education and training thematic area of the SADC Protocol. Education was an important marker of progress in the ability for groups and individuals to access social and economic power. It was thus an important indicator of the positioning of women and men in any country. It was important to understand that availability, accessibility and acceptability of the education facilities were critical to compliance in terms of the provision of education in the country. In South Africa there were two departments of education -- Basic Education and Higher Education &ndash; and it had succeeded in creating a legislative framework in relation to education. Legislation had been promulgated, such as the South African Schools Act 1996, the National Education Policy Act and the South African Council of Educators Act 2000. Apart from legislation South Africa had also devised policies and guidelines. These were the guidelines for the provision of boarding facilities in public ordinary schools on 23 July 2012, and the rights and responsibilities of parents and learners and public schools in the Public School Policy Guide in 2005. These guidelines included improving the access to free and quality basic education to all, on14 June 2003.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gender Based Violence was a form of discrimination which inhibited women&rsquo;s ability to enjoy their rights and freedoms on the basis of equality with men. The Protocol obliged the enactment and enforcement of legislation prohibiting all forms of gender based violence. A legislative framework had been put in place in response to the provisions of the SADC Protocol, as well as other complementing international instruments, in addressing gender based violence. This legislative framework included the South African Constitution, the Domestic Violence Act, the Sexual Offences and Related Matters Amendment act and the DNA Act. Certain programmes had also been put in place, such as the re-establishment of Sexual Offences Courts, to be rolled out across the country by 2017. There were also victim empowerment programmes provided by different departments and civil society organisations, such as the South African Police Service (SAPS), and the Departments of Social Development (DSD), Health and Justice. Another important area where progress had been made was in the area of human trafficking, with acts such as the Human Tissues Act 65 of 1983, the Corruption Act 94 of 1992, the Prevention of Organised Crime Act 121 of 1998, the Refugee Act 67 of 1962 and the Trafficking in Persons Act 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Nzimande outlined South Africa&rsquo;s progress on health, especially in respect of sexual and reproductive health. These rights rested on the recognition of the basic right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health. The legislative framework in relation to health included the Sterilization Act 44 of 1998, the Medical Schemes Act 131 of 1998, the National Health Act 61 of 2003 and the Choice of Termination of Pregnancy Act 92 of 1996. Policies on health, such as the Integrated School Health Policy, had also been developed. The government had also implemented the Integrated Nutrition Programme (INP), HIV counselling and testing policy guidelines, as well as the National Strategic Plan on HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and tuberculosis (TB). The SA National Aids Council (SANAC) had also been established with the objective of advising the government on HIV, AIDS and STI policy and strategy, and related matters. SANAC was also supposed to create and strengthen partnerships for an expanded national response to HIV and AIDS in South Africa, as well as to receive and disseminate all sectoral interventions on HIV and AIDS, and to consider challenges. The Department of Health&rsquo;s 2012/2013 annual reports had indicated that it aimed to improve access to sexual and reproductive health. The three indicators were cervical cancer screening coverage, the couple year protection rate and the percentage of facilities with contraceptive services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The area of media and communication encompassed the right to privacy, as envisaged in section 14 of the Constitution. This involved policies dealing with the information communication technology (ICT) policy review, broadcasting digital migration and broadband. Broadband was an enabling infrastructure for building the knowledge economy and information society, and for accelerating the socio-economic growth and development in South Africa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Nzimande talked about the implementation of the laws. South Africa was complemented by the global community, as well as other treaty bodies, for a good policy and legislative framework. One of the major challenges that had always been highlighted was a lack of knowledge of the frameworks by the beneficiaries. She said that no political will, and a lack of buy-in, had also been mentioned as hindrances in relation to the implementation of the SADC Protocol and other related international treaties. The United Nations (UN) had been having discussions on the post-2015 agenda, while the African Union had launched Agenda 2063, which had also kept the momentum of extending the post-2015 agenda and creating a 50-year target. The MDGs had made a real difference in people&rsquo;s lives, and with strong leadership and accountability this progress had been expanded in most of the world&rsquo;s countries by the target date of 2015. The 2015 agenda, however, entailed efforts to achieve a world of prosperity, equality, freedom, and dignity, and for peace to continue unabated. The 2015 agenda was therefore a continuation of the roadmap paved by the MDGs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She then addressed the issue of poverty and the burden of poverty on women in South Africa. She said that 19 years after the adoption of a platform for action, most South African women still lived in poor conditions with meagre salaries, few skills, poor sanitation and inadequate basic necessities. However, South Africa had placed poverty reduction high on its agenda and had continued to heighten actions and policies to address it through a wide range of strategies. There were programmes in place to assist women and children through social relief strategies, and these programmes were under the auspices of the SA Social Security Agency (SASSA). Women in rural and remote areas constituted the majority of women in South Africa (57%). These areas were characterised by poverty, and women still had difficulties in accessing health and social services. There was a lack of participation in the decision making processes at the community level. Customs and traditional practices, prevalent in rural areas, prevented women from inheriting or acquiring ownership of land and other property. A further challenge was the fact that women had a high level of income poverty, a high rate of unemployment, and non-recognition of women&rsquo;s time spent on unpaid care work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With regard to the agenda post-2015, the UN was working with governments, civil society and other partners to build on the momentum generated by the MDGs. Member states as well as civil society organisations from all over the world had begun to engage in the post-2015 process, while academia and other research institutions, including think tanks, were particularly active on the issue. The post-2015 agenda reflected new development challenges and was linked to the outcome of &ldquo;Rio+20&rdquo;, the sustainable development goals (SDGs) which had emanated from Rio de Janeiro in 2012. The outcome of the Rio+20 &ndash; &ldquo;The Future We Want&rdquo; -- called for the creation of an intergovernmental open working group on SDGs. The SDG proposals contained 18 goals to be attained in 2030 and 169 targets covering sustainable development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Nzimande then shed light on Agenda 2063. The Organisation of African Union (OAU) had been formed in 1963 when several African countries were gaining their independence from colonialism (1960-1970). The OAU had been formed to assist African countries to advance the agenda for economic emancipation, which had led to the creation of continental strategies for economic development. However, all these development strategies were ineffective for African countries because they were never enshrined into the national development plans, except for the New Partnership for Africa&rsquo;s Development (NEPAD). Agenda 2063 had been formed during the 50th anniversary celebrations of the OAU/AU. The 50th anniversary Solemn Declaration entailed Africa&rsquo;s commitment to acknowledging past successes and challenges. The AU had rededicated itself to the continent&rsquo;s development and pledged to make progress in eight key areas. These were African identity and renaissance, plus the struggle against colonialism and the right to self-determination of people still under colonial rule. The next areas were an integration agenda, as well as the agenda for social and economic development. The fifth and sixth areas were peace and security and democratic governance, and the last two areas were determining Africa&rsquo;s destiny and Africa&rsquo;s place in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Nzimande then described South Africa&rsquo;s agenda for 2063. South Africa had submitted two reports to the AU on the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM), one in 2007 and the second in 2011. The purpose of the exercise was to share with other peer African countries what South Africa had achieved over the past few years, in pursuit of the objectives enshrined in the Constitutive Act of the African Union. South African initiatives on Agenda 2063 included Project Ndabezitha, which advocated effective implementation of the Domestic Violence Act, the establishment of the Ministry of Women, as well as the implementation of the Public Service Gender Equality strategy, which had assisted government to attain the 50% target representation of women. South Africa was hosting the AU Summit and the theme was &ldquo;2015 Year of Women&rsquo;s Empowerment and Developments towards Africa&rsquo;s Agenda 2063.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Commission was monitoring compliance with international instruments. It had produced three baseline reports on the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the Beijing Platform for Action (BPA) and the MDGs. The reports presented the status of the country in terms of compliance and adherence to international standards. The Commission was currently undertaking the project of the African Gender Development Index (AGDI) which was a follow up process after the pilot that had been conducted in 2005. The AGDI was a tool that the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) had developed to provide member states with a monitoring mechanism for tracking their performance in implementing their international and regional gender commitments. The tool allowed African policy makers and their partners to assess their own performance in implementing policies and programmes aimed at ending women&rsquo;s marginalisation and achieving gender equality. It consisted of two parts: the quantitative Gender Status Index (GSI) and the qualitative African Women&rsquo;s Progress Scoreboard (AWPS). The AGDI was a valuable and comprehensive tool for streamlining reporting on all regional and international gender documents, such as the MDG, BPA, CEDAW, the African Charter on Human and People&rsquo;s Rights, and the Protocol on the Rights of Women in Africa. The AGDI was intended to address the lack of sex-disaggregated data and to overcome the technical challenges for tracking progress in the advancement of women and gender equality. In developing this index, UNECA hoped, among other things, to democratise statistics and qualitative monitoring tools that were easy to use and were effective, as well as to stimulate interdepartmental cooperation within the ministries in which it would be applied. There was a lack of gender disaggregated data, especially on the beneficiaries of social security, which made it difficult to measure progression in terms of poverty alleviation. In addition, there was a need to come up with strategies that would be suitable to the beneficiaries, to prevent the persisting dependency syndrome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms M Chueu (ANC) commented that she would like to see solutions to all the problems raised. She understood that South Africa was a divided society and as African women, they were vocal about their oppression but did not know what affected other women. They therefore never came up with solutions that addressed these women from other racial groups. African women were therefore like a capitalist society, where the most vocal people were the people making profit. The problem was that the CGE had never asked these women what affected them, so they were not getting anywhere. The Commission was not going out there to find out what was happening. The focus was on rural women, but township women also had problems that needed to be addressed. They should challenge each woman to do what Cuba had done in 1959. Each person must have a person to educate, and to take responsibility for pulling that person to the level where they were. In this way, ten years down the line, they would have managed the problem. Information had to be shared with the person you were mentoring. When South Africa reverted to the SADC, they would have a strategy. Ms Chueu also asked the CGE to call in professional women to check what impact women in high positions were making. A meeting of female CEOs was supposed to be convened, and they were to be asked to get targets of women in their sphere of influence that they could impact. South Africa had made a lot of progress in terms of affirmative action, but this had benefited white women yet it was intended to benefit women of all races. The women CEOs must help to empower other women. She focused on the plight of female lawyers, saying that the judiciary had become independent but there were no women. They could call in the lawyers&rsquo; associations, and ask them what their problems were in respect of women. Another option was to call in the Minister and discuss the matter with her, because they were running out of time. Tanzania had overtaken South Africa, as they had gone quite far in empowering their women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms C Majeke (ANC) cited the example of her son, who was considered an illegal immigrant in South Africa. She had gone through the whole process of getting an identity document, and it had taken two years. She had filed affidavits for a long time, but it had still been a long process. Her son had a Swaziland driver&rsquo;s licence and a South African ID. It had been so difficult for her as a Member of Parliament, and she could imagine how difficult it was for other women. She then raised the issue of human trafficking and wanted to comment about an incident in Mthatha. A taxi had been discovered that was full of young children who were being stolen from pre-schools by Pakistani nationals. In this particular incident, a child had been snatched from an old lady outside Home Affairs. The old lady had screamed and some people had managed to help her. The child was being taken into a vehicle which was full of sweets and biscuits. The police and the army had responded quickly and had managed to cordon off the area. Therefore it was critical to ensure that children were safe and were not being trafficked. She also highlighted the problem of young girls marrying foreign nationals for IDs. These girls would have children and after a few years those children would be taken out of the country and given to the foreign nationals&rsquo; wives. She asked Members to go back to their constituencies and come back with information. She also talked about disabled children who still did not have grants, although some grants were being used by people who were not disabled. She had tried to report this to social workers, but nothing was being done. Most of the victims were disabled people who were being neglected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Speaker, Ms Mbete, asked what the issues in other communities in South African society were. These issues were not on the table. She had become aware a few years ago of the issue of incest in the Jewish community. She had mentioned this at a meeting and an elderly Jewish lady who was present had been embarrassed and had said that women could not speak up because they were sworn to secrecy. Parliament had also put in place policies on sexual harassment, and a scenario had arisen where a young journalist had had a relationship with a senior Member of Parliament and had been beaten up very badly. The young journalist had reported the matter, but had later dropped the case because she had been pressured by female Members. Young women needed support rather than condemnation, and women were part of the struggle. There was no need for them to be shy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Mbete then spoke about the African Peer Review Mechanism, where she had insight because she had been sent on one such review. The APRM was often quickly dismissed as not having teeth as it had faced many challenges since its inception 11 to 12 years ago. When members of the APRM were sent to other countries, this made heads of state feel threatened. The APRM was important for African states, as these reviews were not under a government&rsquo;s control, but were a continental mandate. On these trips, the first port of call was the office of the president. Some presidents were receptive, but some of them were threatened. As women, they had to insist on finding out how the country was doing in terms of gender equality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Mbete highlighted that the APRM had been developed by President Mbeki and President Obasanjo of Nigeria. The advantages of the APRM were that it was up to a woman to get into a country and to every sector of that country and address them, and to empower them to understand that it was platform for them to speak honestly and not to be ashamed. Africans had to help themselves with their challenges. when the first APRM was conducted in South Africa, it had been defensive. Before the first round of xenophobia erupted, this had been highlighted by the APRM, and South Africa had denied it. The same thing had happened in Kenya where the APRM had highlighted certain issues and the Kenyans had denied it, thereafter there had been a huge explosion. Africans had to help each other and understand that the intention was not to attack or punish one another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Elizabeth Thabethe, Deputy Minister of Small Business Development, said that the report was a good basis for dealing with the problem issues. It was a pity that most women missed the workshop, because it had clarified a lot of the issues. She commended the CGE&rsquo;s paper as being straightforward but wanted more detail on certain issues. The report had covered progress on education and poverty, but other streams had not been there. It had not dealt with the issue of women&rsquo;s economic empowerment, the legislation that had been passed and its implementation and progress. She queried the term &ldquo;most&rdquo; in describing women that were living in poverty, and asked instead for the use of percentages. She also wanted clarity on the differences between urban women and rural women. For example, the Employment Equity Act empowered white women, and nobody else. Everyone else was discriminated against. She also wanted to know why the Commission was not putting emphasis on the economic sector. There were issues affecting women in the rural areas, such as ukutwala. She said it was necessary to look not only at older women but the girls of today, as they were the women of tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another question she raised was how girl children were doing academically. She had read a report that said most entrants in universities were now girls. There was therefore a shift from before, where young girls were not admitted to university. Now girls were excelling and going further. She also highlighted that there was no mention of the progress of women in business. Prior to 1994, women were not in business, but after 21 years there had been progress and there had been economic achievements, and not just in terms of social grants. She also agreed with the Commission that Parliament was under-reporting its achievements. One such achievement had been the training of women to be placed in boards. There were 300 women that had been trained on how to be members of a board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms P Bengu (ANC) said that South Africa had implemented a comprehensive HIV and AIDS policy. She also touched on the issue of poverty and unemployment affecting women. During their oversight visits, the Committee had noted that women were recipients of grants and ARVs. After they took the ARVs and their health improved, their grants were eventually terminated and eventually their ARV treatment was also discontinued. At the SADC Protocol meeting, they had talked about these grants being terminated and the discontinuation of the ARV treatment. What was the Commission doing, and were the women being sent back to doctors to ensure that they continued the ARV treatment?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"_GoBack\"></a> Ms S Nkomo (ANC), Deputy Chairperson, thanked the Speaker in absentia and spoke about the influence of women in positions of power, but who were not influencing change. For example, there was the issue of recycling, with the same women sitting on boards. She also addressed the issue of capacity building and economic challenges, and said there was a need to revive government&rsquo;s commitment in this area. She focused on the issue of the provision of adequate prevention treatment and support to deal with HIV and AIDS, and said there still seemed to be problems 35 years after the scourge had been discovered. The statistics seemed to be going up instead of down. Other countries like Uganda, in 15 to 20 years had experienced a drop in the HIV rate and yet they had had no budget for condoms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Nkomo requested further elaboration on the issue of Project Ndabezitha, and wanted to know how this project came about. Poverty had the face of women, and this was an area of the MDGs that had not been met. She wanted Members to be honest about why the goals had not been met. She requested clarity on the issue of cervical cancer screening, and whether it was being done in urban or rural areas, as well as about other types of cancer, such as prostate and breast cancer. Another issue she touched on was the issue of human trafficking. An act had been promulgated on 1 June 2015 whereby minor children were required to travel with unabridged birth certificates. This was a serious matter. Some children had their organs removed to give to other people, so the promotion of such laws was important. They needed to engage the private sector and tourism so they could understand the challenges in this area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Chueu stated that there had been no assessment of the private sector in the report although the Commission was mandated to look at both the public and the private sector. The Commission had to come up with clear successes as it was being too economical with information. If something was repeated over and over again, it would become easy to recall. There was therefore a need to unpack poverty, unemployment and inequality. There was a need to be clear on what these terms meant. She narrated the plight of women on the coast who had indigenous knowledge on how to extract oysters. These women had taken the government to court in order to allow them to continue harvesting oysters for a living. This scenario was proof that there was a lot of knowledge at the country&rsquo;s disposal which was not being used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Nkomo spoke about Project Ndabezitha, and said there was a component of society where there was a high degree of patriarchy. Traditional leaders had an attitude towards women, although the young traditional leaders seemed to have a better attitude. Some traditional leaders did not even cater for women and to them, women were minors. The situation was even worse when a woman lost a husband and was fighting <em>ukungenwa</em> (a traditional custom whereby a widowed woman automatically becomes her brother-in-law&#39;s wife, or is regarded as inherited by her brother-in-law), even though a woman had a right to say no. At times they would be harassed by the <em>induna,</em> or forced to accept it in a discreet way, such as reducing the size of their farm. She said the caucus needed to do oversight because women were getting a raw deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms T Memela (ANC) said that women had really suffered and the Speaker had managed to touch on sensitive issues. She did not know why women were keeping quiet when they covered up the rape of their children by an uncle. She asked why women condoned such practices and said it was time to tell men that enough was enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Nkomo said that it was time to ruffle some feathers when examining those matters. When the Members examined these issues, they needed to tell their own stories. Members could not assist with healing unless they helped others. She gave the example of Members who were unmarried -- they were unmarried because they had left their husbands. They had had to divorce people who had put them down, and they had had to speak the truth. Many women were sitting in Parliament only because they did not have husbands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson said many questions had been put to the Commission. The Commission&rsquo;s report had detailed what had been done, but there were no concrete suggestions about what they saw emanating from the challenges. As public representatives, there were other things they had wanted to hear, and the Commission had been established for this reason. She queried why no action plan had been brought to Parliament and why there had been no comment about the Kadar Asmal Report. She wanted to know what lessons had been learnt from that report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Lieketseng Mohlakoane-Motopi, Researcher, Commission for Gender Equality, said there was no concentration in research on minority groups, especially within South Africa. In compiling the report, there had been a lack of data from the relevant sectors. Most of CGE&rsquo;s statistics on women were from Statistics South Africa. The majority of women were in rural and traditional settlements, and there were also some women in informal schemes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She said that the social security agencies provided details only on the number of women receiving specific types of grants and did not specify the gender of those receiving the grants. Education was also a problem. They were receiving raw data on dropouts whereby a certain number of students entered universities, but later half of them did not graduate. She was of the opinion that the Cuba example would not be applicable in the South African context. She had participated briefly in the AU Summit, and women from the rural areas had been given the opportunity to relate their stories and how they wanted to be assisted. In this instance, they had made strides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Nkomo interjected, and raised a point of order on the issue of Cuba, saying there was a need to go deeper and separate the issues. However, the bottom line was that mentorship should be encouraged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Mohlakoane-Motopi said she agreed with the Member, and women had been given a chance to explain their plight. Women had been brought in from Benin, Cote D&rsquo;Ivoire and South Africa, and this qualified as mentorship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Nzimande said that the CGE would work on integrating the suggestions in their future report. The Commission generally summarised the successes in order to provide a useful report. On the issue of race, the Commission wanted to focus on issues that affected men and women differently, regardless of race. She spoke about economic empowerment and said that banks were still reluctant to give women loans. She also touched on gender based violence, which was experienced by all races. The Commission had also made an input to the Muslim Marriage Bill in an attempt to improve the lives of men and women. She said Project Ndabezitha had been established through Memorandums of Understanding which had been signed with a number of traditional leaders and the National House of Traditional Leaders. There was a need to devise non-abrasive ways of working with the traditional leaders. There was a need to address the limitations of traditional leaders and how they dealt with matters. The aim was to try and ensure that domestic violence cases were not dealt with in traditional courts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Nzimande said that the private sector was being monitored through an agreement with the Employment Equity Commission. A number of reports by the Commission had been lodged with the Speaker. With regard to indigenous knowledge, the CGE had not yet dealt with this issue in relation to men and women. The Kadar Asmal Report was still in the Speaker&rsquo;s possession and she was working with all the Chapter 9 intstitutions in this regard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson thanked the Commission for the report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Presentation by AIDS Rights Alliance for Southern Africa (ARASA)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms He-Jin Kim, Regional Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex (LGBTI) Programme Officer, ARASA, said ARASA was a regional organisation consisting of eight organisations in South and East Africa. The organisation was focusing on moving forward. Progress had been made in meeting the SADC Protocol targets, but many challenges remained. It was important to acknowledge that South Africa had a unique context-- it had a very unique constitution and emphasis on human rights. South Africa had also made great strides in gender parity in government. The legislative protocol did not necessarily lead to social change on its own. SADC Protocol did not focus on creating legislation and there were no measurable targets to monitor enforcement of any legislation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She said she wanted to focus on three main topics, which were HIV and AIDS, sex work and LGBTI. HIV was a major issue in South Africa and 60% of people with HIV in South Africa were women, thus making HIV a feminised epidemic. There were many condoms available but there had no major decrease because HIV had a specific social environment, leading to HIV. It was important to understand what fuelled the HIV stigma. There was no environment where tools such as condoms could be used. It was still hard for married women to negotiate condom use. Men generally moved to mines and had multiple partners and returned home to their wives. Young women were also not allowed to talk about sexuality. There was a need to acknowledge the diversity of women. These groups of women were not living separately, but were interacting with each other. There had been progress in the plan for dealing with HIV, but sustainable change had to be ensured. She acknowledged that the SADC Protocol did refer to harmful cultural practices and a prevailing sense of patriarchy, and referred to the HIV Stigma Index which had serious concerns, such as underage women being sterilised against their will. Women still bore the brunt of the stigma.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next area of concern was the area of sex work. This was a very vulnerable group, and South Africa still criminalised sex work. There was a need to exert pressure to secure sex workers&rsquo; access to rights. Sex workers could not report rape to the police, as they would get arrested or raped again by the police. They also had no access to bank accounts and health services. It was important to draw a distinction between sex work and human trafficking, which was a broader issue. Sex work was driven by socio-economic circumstances. Criminalising sex was criminalising people for their poverty. From a human rights perspective, one could not address human trafficking by criminalising sex work. It was important to work with the sex workers and to empower them to make the right choices. It was a controversial but important issue. In the context of human trafficking, it was important to address the issue. Women and girls were not the same -- women were adults and able to make certain choices that girls were not able to make. One could not simply implement policies and address them in the same way. There was a need for different approaches for different age groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Kim then went on to address the issue of LGBTI and remarked that South Africa had been a paradise for LGBTI. It was the only country in the world that had included sexual orientation in its constitution. There was extraordinarily strong language that protected the LGBTI&rsquo;s rights. These were people who did not conform to very strict norms and one had to understand the diversity of what people were. Heinous crimes were committed against LGBTI and it pained him to see civil society ignore this. These issues did not only affect gay and lesbian people but affected everyone. Often LGBTI were accused of fraud and were ridiculed at Home Affairs. They had difficulty in accessing education, and societal attitudes permeated into government institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Discussion</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson said the issue of sex work and LGBTI was interesting for them to understand. She wanted to know what the alteration of the Sex Description &amp; Sex Status Act meant to LGBTI people. These issues did come up at various religious platforms, where people told about their personal experiences. By now, the Commission should be talking about LGBTI. Some people were denying their own children because they were LGBTI, and because they did not understand. Public representatives therefore had to learn a lot about this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Memela said some parents rejected their children because they thought it was just a game. She also said that there was a weakness in parents monitoring their children, as one could easily pick up if your child was LGBTI at adolescence. There was a proposal that there should be a group of doctors to deal exclusively with LGBTI people, because they were still being ostracised. She was to have a meeting later that week, as she had received quite a lot of letters around the issue. She also wanted to call in the judiciary and wanted to talk to them about rapes and assaults that were reported, but then nothing would be done. There was a lack of understanding, but LGBTI had to be accepted as part of society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Nkomo said the information received was very valuable, especially the fact that 60% of people living with HIV were women. Women were more disadvantaged, and she wanted more information because it was a large number of women who were affected. She wanted to know if there were public or private support centres for women with HIV. She also wanted to know whether transgender people were receiving therapy. Many of them turned to suicide, and there was a need to ensure that they were taken care of. Referring to the issue of hate crimes, she mentioned the incident of a young woman who had been stoned. She wanted to know how serious the problem was in other countries, and whether it was manifesting itself at such an alarming rate. If the LGBTI were being ostracized and not being given birth certificates, there had to be a lot of sensitivity around this area. Were pamphlets being distributed to educate people about the issue?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Chueu said the Commission should not be treated too harshly, but they had to be conscious about issues that were being presented, such as the issue of 60% of people living with HIV were women. Ms Chueu said this was an oversight on the Commission&rsquo;s part, as these issues had not been highlighted. She wanted more information on the matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Mwaila (ANC) Ms Boitumelo Moiloa (ANC) said they had to work hard, even though South Africa had policies and Acts, as there was no monitoring and evaluation of the Acts. In future, it would be necessary to take stock of what steps to take and to make representations to the provinces. There was a need for information to be dealt with at grassroots level, as well as to address the stereotypical society, particularly on the issue of discrimination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ds M Khoza (ANC) wanted to comment on sex work. She said no programme had been designed to help them to assess their challenges, especially in relation to health. This was a particular concern of hers because she had a background in social work and had encountered sex workers during her work with street children. The sex workers were risking their lives and they got paid very little. She wanted to know what was being done to avert these high risks. Another challenge faced by sex workers was accommodation -- they had to find a place to sleep and they needed assistance. The little that they had made during that night was spent paying for accommodation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Kim said she hoped there would be future engagement on this issue. There were LGBTI organisations in every province. The problem with the organisations was that they were very small and did not always know how to approach Parliament. The Department of Health provided many services and the budget was big, but these were general services, such as testing and counselling. Any special services were being provided by civil society. In terms of counselling for LGBTI people, there was a counselling centre in Gauteng, two in Cape Town and one in the Eastern Cape. These organisations often struggled to provide services due to the volume of cases. There had been a centre at Baragwanath Hospital but it had been closed down. The biggest facility was at Groote Schuur Hospital, which had a gender clinic. These facilities were overburdened, and had no capacity to deal with these issues. Transgender people often suffered from depression, had no medical aid and were unemployed. There was a lack of education among health care professionals themselves, as the topic was not found in health care curricula. It was important to sensitise health care professionals, but it was difficult to get them to come to workshops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hate crimes were not necessarily on the increase, but the reporting of such crimes had increased. The problem, however, was the slow reaction of the authorities. A case in Khayelitsha had taken nine years to be heard, but the situation was slowly changing, as two cases were being heard this year. The Department of Justice&rsquo;s response had not been good. In relation to the enquiry on hate crimes in Europe, she said that this was not a common phenomenon. It was also important to look at the context. The rate of gender based violence in South Africa was very high, therefore the rate of hate crimes against LGBTI people was also high. Organisations such as Sex Workers Education and Advocacy Taskforce (SWEAT) and Sonke Gender Justice were arguing for the decriminalisation of sex work and a moratorium on the arresting of sex workers, but this had not been pushed forward. This was a controversial issue, especially because other women&rsquo;s organisations had not supported them. It was important to engage with these organisations and ask them how sex workers were going to be protected. He said Sonke was actually made up of sex workers, so they were the best organisation to engage. Sonke had experienced success in Cape Town with the Western Cape SAPS. They had also addressed the issues of arbitrary arrest and extortion. She highlighted the need to address the diversity of sex workers, as there were a lot of forms of sex work. Sex workers were working on the streets, but could be found only in the evening. There were a lot of very different ways in which sex workers could earn money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Mohlakoane-Motopi, from the CGE, said that she wanted to touch on the sex work issue. The Commission had released a position paper and a policy brief to mobilise for the decriminalisation of sex work. The Commission had also been in the media and engaged with organisations on the issue. The work in this area was on-going, and they had not been aware that there were organisations that did not know of the work which the Commission was doing with sex workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson thanked the presenters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Provincial priorities with regard to post-2015 SADC Protocol on Gender Equality</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>KwaZulu-Natal</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Disapi (ANC), the representative of Kwazulu-Natal, said she was disappointed because she thought the Commission would have touched on the area of early pregnancies in schools, violence in schools, drug abuse and forced marriages. As the province was more rural, these things were happening on a daily basis. She also wanted to hear more about the package for people with disabilities. It was common knowledge that they were still dealing with various social ills such as domestic abuse, rape and murder of women, especially elderly women and girl children. She wanted to highlight the massive achievements that had occurred since the government had come into power in 1994. It was a matter of considerable pride that many of the rights and freedoms women had fought for were now entrenched in the constitution. Gender equality was now a constitutional imperative and was enforced by various legal instruments including the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act (PEPUDA), the Employment Equity Act and the Civil Union Act. The representation of women in Parliament had increased phenomenally. Similarly, in terms of the provincial legislatures, representation of women had drastically improved. In their provincial legislature, most of the institution&rsquo;s presiding officers were women including herself, as the chairperson of the quality of life of the women&rsquo;s caucus. The Deputy Chairperson of committees was a woman, the deputy chief whip was a woman and many committees were chaired by women. Even the secretary of the legislature was a woman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A census conducted by the Businesswomen&rsquo;s Association of South Africa had shown that gender balance remained slow in the private sector, and therefore the struggle had to be intensified for the representation of women in the private sector. The private sector needed to take serious introspection to see how it had fared, compared to the public sector. The National Developmental Plan was a developmental blueprint for the country, and advocated infrastructural development. Women needed to look at this plan through a gender lens to see how they could fit in and how it could be used to advance women&rsquo;s economic interests. Women were still on the economic periphery and the majority of women could still be found in the informal sector working as hawkers on city pavements and at taxi ranks. There was therefore a need to integrate them into a formal economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013 when the women&rsquo;s parliament was sitting, a number of resolutions had been taken, calling on government and the private sector to intervene in alleviating the plight of women of Kwa-Zulu Natal, especially in the rural areas. These resolutions included the need for the government to strengthen partnerships with rural communities to eliminate the culture of ukutwala. The government had to award feeding scheme contracts to women co-operatives. In order to promote women&rsquo;s empowerment, monitoring mechanisms had to be put in place to curb fronting and ensure wealth distribution. Government had to ensure that projects that were created for women and aimed at eliminating poverty, were long term based and sustainable. Government had to also ensure that tractors were widely distributed to areas that were headed by women. Government had to ensure that sexual offences courts were prioritised to ensure that the roll out of these courts was not hampered by obstacles that led to their demise. Government was also supposed to conduct an audit on the affirmative action policy, to ascertain its relevance. Government had to ensure that more women were promoted to managerial positions and 50% representation had to be ensured in all government departments. It should consider giving financial assistance to people with disabilities towards transport costs when seeking grants, and had to employ more staff and assure the provision of refreshments for those awaiting assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>North-West Province</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Mwaila (ANC), Ms Boitumelo Moiloa (ANC) from the North-west Province. apologised for not bringing a formal report from the province. This was because they had not elected the person who was chairing the women&rsquo;s caucus. In their last sitting they had been told that they should choose a person to deal with gender issues as a representative on behalf of the province. The province would later e-mail a formal report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She summarised what the province was doing in terms of addressing women&rsquo;s issues. The provincial Speaker had a programme in her office. The Speaker, her deputy and the secretary were all women. However, there were very few women in the legislature because most of the women had been taken to the executive side, and they had been left with three women. The Speaker had a programme that dealt with women&rsquo;s issues, and through this programme they were taking parliament to the people. When they took parliament to the people, they focused on the issues raised by women about themselves and took different cases and referred them to the relevant departments. After the referrals, the legislature monitored the progress in terms of the referrals. There had been an incident of a child who was forced to sleep with a teacher in order to get progression. She had taken the case and they had managed to get the case to the relevant department and were monitoring the progress. She added that the rest of the plans would be delivered later, as she could not present on issues for which she had not been given a mandate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Eastern Cape</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms D Nkomose (ANC) went straight to the eight strategic priorities of the province. The first priority was speeding up growth and transforming the economy to create decent work and sustainable livelihoods. There was a massive programme to build social and economic infrastructure, rural development, land and agrarian transformation, as well as food security. They also aimed to strengthen education and the human resource base, to improve the health profile of the province and to intensify the fight against crime and corruption. The province was also focusing on building a developmental state and cohesive and sustainable communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She then highlighted 12 practical areas of issues of concern. These areas were women and poverty, women and health, violence against women, women and armed conflict, women in the economy, women in power and decision making, institutionalised mechanisms for the advancement of women, women and the media, women and the environment, and lastly, the girl child. She provided a situational analysis from the fourth and fifth term. In the fourth term, of 63 members of the legislature, there had been 29 women and in 2014, out of 10 MECS, five of them were women. In 2014, out of 17 chairpersons of portfolio committees, six of them were women. In the fifth term there had been a significant improvement in all the previously mentioned committees. Most notable was the fact that the Speaker and Deputy Speaker were both women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the way forward goals, the Eastern Cape wanted to engender awareness and respect for the human and socio-economic rights of women and children. They also intended to engage in public participation from 27 to 30 July. Last year, they had had public participation as a build up towards 9 August and had included legal experts from the legislature and educated people on issues of maintenance and their rights. They had also engaged on issues of girls married to foreigners, and the danger that they were in. They had visited the courts that were not sympathetic towards women&rsquo;s issues. They had also visited police stations that had not taken rape seriously, thereby making women afraid to approach those police stations. They also intended to promote the women&rsquo;s caucus&rsquo; mandate on gender equality. They had provided support to the women&rsquo;s caucuses in Parliament. She highlighted the challenge in Eastern Cape, when circumcisions take place in June. They had clubbed together with the Imbumbayama Nkosikazi, and were on board to eliminate the death of boys. They had also collaborated with the Commission on Gender Equality and the Human Rights Commission in dealing with issues affecting women and children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Nkomose went through the programme of action, which included being responsive to gender-based violence and following up on such cases. Another goal was to enhance public participation through the public participation week. They would take opportunities to interact with the communities. They were also formulating educational programmes that sought to reduce child mortality and improve maternal health. They had launched a campaign against harmful cultural practices. They had an issue in Mzamba, where women&rsquo;s wombs were removed from them while they were still alive. As a women&rsquo;s caucus, they had visited that area, and had built some houses for the victims in consultation with the Human Settlements MEC, who was a woman. Their goal was to ensure political tolerance when organising women&rsquo;s events, and they had engaged with municipalities to form their own caucuses. Another goal was to enhance the participation of women in political, economic and social life through activities that changed people&rsquo;s lives. They also wanted to encourage men to be potential partners in campaigns to end gender-based violence. They aimed to influence gender-sensitive planning and budgeting, as well as accountability on gender mainstreaming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They wanted to maintain sound working relations with stakeholders and to ensure female representation in senior management in all spheres and levels of government. One of their objectives was to engage in capacity building and information sharing programmes, to strengthen the leadership and public participation. Another objective was to work with business and traditional leaders and all women&rsquo;s formations in public participation. They wanted understand the legal environment around gender equality and women empowerment, and encouraged their legal teams to go and educate people about the constitution, policies and their rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She concluded by showing a photo of someone who had been hacked to death by a Malawian national. This had been in one of the areas they were going to visit and assist the family in whatever way they could, including sending a team to check on the family, as well as social workers. There was also the Ndabakazi issue. A serial killer had killed about 25 single women who were staying with their grandparents. The serial killer had been doing this for about two consecutive years. As women, they had been there to assist those women until the perpetrator was found, and sentenced to three life sentences. They had managed to talk to the police and the commissioner into building a police station in that rural area. They were still going to visit the areas as a build up to Women&rsquo;s Month. The multi-party women&rsquo;s caucus acknowledged the priority areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson thanked the provinces for their reports and the progress. She hoped the provinces that were not present would provide their reports. She asked Ms Chueu and Ms Nkomo to summarise the proceedings of the day and the resolutions of the day, if there were any.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Summary of Workshop</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Nkomo said that it was quite an interesting day, with valuable input from the Chairperson. There were not many people who had made presentations but so far the people that had come had given them valuable programmes. She thanked the Commission on Gender and Equality for their valuable information, which they had worked on while they were sitting there. They had come up with resolutions that Ms Chueu would go through. She asked the presenters to take note that as part of the Committee&rsquo;s oversight function, they would be interrogating certain issues and ruffle some feathers, but this was part of their job for the sake of ensuring that things moved forward. She applauded the provinces that had honoured the invitation from the Committee, and told them that they would definitely be interacting with them, visiting them and doing oversight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Resolutions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Chueu read out the resolutions for the Multi-Party Women&rsquo;s Caucus Workshop on the implementation of the SADC Protocol on Gender and Development and the post-2015 agenda. They supported the post-2015 agenda for the sustainable development goals to include a stand-alone goal on gender equality, noting the African Union Agenda 2063 and welcoming the declaration of 2015 as the year of women&rsquo;s empowerment and development towards Africa&rsquo;s agenda 2063. They also recognised the importance of women Members of Parliament using their influence to impact on the lives of ordinary women through their work. They therefore resolved the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. In the absence of the legislated quotas, they needed to advocate in political parties ahead of the 2016 local government elections to input a 50/50 quota.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. To continue to lobby for quotas in order to reach a 50/50 level in provinces and national government, whether through reviewing existing legislation or initiating new policies. Quotas should not relate only to political decision making within the provinces, but also had to apply to all levels of society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Monitor existing gender equality legislation and look at resources, improve oversight to improve implementation and ensure that they had a positive impact on the lives of ordinary women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. There was a need to focus on women of all races across all sectors, and women had to be dealt with not as a homogenous group -- they had to be separated in terms of rural women and township women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Ensure effective public participation by engaging directly with women to see that their interests were adequately represented and that there was adequate continuous engagement with civil society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Ensure that women were mainstreamed into the economy and make sure they benefited from legislation aimed at ensuring equal participation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. Review gender responsive budgeting within departments to ensure adequate resources were directed towards gender equality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8. Provide gender disaggregated data to all the departments for more evidence-based policy making and to ensure that programming for women begins to address their particular needs more accurately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9. Encourage the mentoring of women in all sectors in order for them to take up positions of decision making, including in the judiciary, the private sector and the public sector institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10. Ensure that programmes in government adequately addressed women&rsquo;s particular reproductive health challenges, including early screening for cervical cancer and the continued high HIV infection rate amongst women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>11. Continue to work to integrate the country&rsquo;s approach to dealing with gender-based violence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>12. Continue to work to ensure that legislatures were gender-sensitive institutions that adequately dealt with issues such as sexual harassment, fair parental leave for both men and women, and adequate facilities to accommodate all Members of Parliament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>13. There was still a need to put more emphasis on issues affecting persons with disabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>14. Ensure that they harness the indigenous knowledge of women better, including traditional medicine and indigenous farming methods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>15. To ensure the enforcement of legislation meant to protect the rights and interest of vulnerable groups, including the LGBTI communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>16. To deal directly with patriarchy and its social and cultural and economic manifestations, and for both male and female Members of Parliament, in their leadership capacity, to promote and engage with and encourage gender parity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson thanked all the presenters that had managed to come -- it was not about numbers, but what was important was what had come out of the discussions. What was also important was for the Members to understand from the people that they had invited what areas were experiencing challenges in relation to the laws that they were passing in Parliament. This would enable them, as public representatives, to do their work when they went to constituency offices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson thanked the staff of Parliament who had assisted with organising the workshop. She also thanked the Members for being leaders that were concerned, and for their active participation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The meeting was adjourned.</p>\r\n",

        "summary": "<p>The Commission for Gender Equality (CGE) presented its report on the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Protocol on Gender and Development, which had committed signatories to achieving 28 substantive targets aimed at promoting gender equality. The aim of the Protocol was to empower women socially, economically and politically, to eliminate discrimination, and to achieve gender equality through gender-responsive legislation, policies and projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CGE gave a breakdown of South Africa&rsquo;s progress and successes in each of the thematic areas contained in the Protocol. South Africa had succeeded in the thematic area of education and training. In the area of gender-based violence, the Protocol obliged the enactment and enforcement of legislation prohibiting all forms of this, and acts such as the Domestic Violence Act had been put in place for this reason. In the area of health, South Africa had managed to make progress in the area of sexual and reproductive health with the enactment of legislation such as the Choice of Termination of Pregnancy Act 92 of 1996, and had also made progress in the area of media and communication. Although there had been progress in terms of the enactment of legislation, the country was still struggling with its implementation. The major challenge was a lack of knowledge of the frameworks by the beneficiaries. Another major source of concern was the burden of poverty on women, but programmes had been put in place to assist women and children through social relief strategies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post-2015 agenda reflected new development challenges linked to the outcome of the &ldquo;RIO+20&rdquo; and the sustainable development goals developed in Brazil in 2012. There had been a strong proposal for a stand-alone goal on gender equality. Another significant item on the agenda for 2015 was Agenda 2063, which was aimed at rededicating the African continent to its development and acknowledging past successes and failures. South Africa had developed its own responses to Agenda 2063, with projects such as Project Ndabezitha which was advocating for the implementation of the Domestic Violence Act. The Commission was also actively monitoring compliance with international instruments and had produced reports on their findings. The Commission was currently undertaking the project of the African Gender Development Index (AGDI) which was a follow up to the pilot that had been conducted in 2005. The AGDI was a tool that allowed African policy makers and their partners to assess their own performance in implementing policies and programmes aimed at ending women&rsquo;s marginalisation and achieving gender equality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Members highlighted some on the areas that they wished had been included in the report. The Deputy Minister for Small Business Development would have liked to have seen more reports of success in women&rsquo;s economic empowerment, and more progress on the young girls who were the girls today but the women tomorrow. The Speaker of Parliament highlighted the need to focus on the plight of women in other racial demographic groups. This was reinforced by another Member, who insisted that there was a need to interact with women from different races and assess their needs. The CGE was also asked to focus on the plight of women with disabilities, as well as women living with HIV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The AIDS Rights Alliance of Southern African (ARASA) addressed three major areas of concern -- HIV/AIDs, sex workers and the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex (LGBTI) communities. AIDS was described as a feminised epidemic, because 60% of the people infected with AIDS were women. It was important to create an environment where women were empowered to negotiate condom use, even in marriage. The biggest challenge faced by sex workers was the criminalisation of sex work, which made sex workers a very vulnerable group of women. Sex workers could not access bank accounts and health care services, and were often victimised by police when they reported rape. There was a need to engage civil society such as SWEAT and Sonke Gender Justice on the issues affecting prostitutes, and to protect them better through legislation. The LGBTI faced a host of challenges, such as the violent crimes committed against lesbians -- the so-called corrective rape. Some of them faced discrimination at the hands of government officials. Many suffered from depression and were unemployed, which affected their quality of life. There was a need to create greater awareness among society and health care practitioners regarding the plight of LGBTI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Members said the presentation had provided insight into a very important issue, and they provided examples of challenges facing the LGBTI community from their personal experiences. They expressed interest in knowing what type of support mechanisms were in place for LGBTI. Were there counselling centres and any other support mechanisms? In many cases, LGBTI people turned to suicide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Representatives from the Eastern Cape, North West and KwaZulu-Natal highlighted the challenges and strategies which they had each adopted in order to address the requirements of the Protocol. KwaZulu-Natal highlighted several social ills that they faced as a province that was mostly rural. They needed help to abolish practices such as <em>ukutwala</em>. In the North West, they were doing their best to take parliament to the people. They were engaging with women on issues that affected them and were helping to link women with the relevant government agencies that they could approach for assistance. In the Eastern Cape they managed to assist vulnerable women by engaging the police and ensuring that certain unsafe rural areas had police stations built within them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "body": "<p><strong>Chairperson&rsquo;s opening remarks </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chairperson Bhengu indicated that the Portfolio Committee on Social Development had invited the Portfolio Committee on Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries, the Portfolio Committee on Rural Development and Land Reform, the Portfolio Committee on Social Development and the Portfolio Committee on Basic Education to the meeting. She thanked all Members for attending the meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms A Steyn (DA) appreciated the work the Chairperson had done in putting together the meeting. She asked why only Massmart and Tiger Brands were invited. Space should be opened up for more stakeholders to participate in such discussions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chairperson Bhengu responded that ten other stakeholders were invited but only four responded. She indicated that the Portfolio Committee on Small Business Development was meeting with Massmart for the second time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Presentation: Massmart</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Brian Leroni, Group Corporate Affairs Executive, Massmart, thanked the Chairperson for the invitation. He indicated that the presentation would focus on outlining Massmart&rsquo;s estimated retail share in the fresh produce market. The food market was divided into the fresh market, dry groceries market, the beverage market and perishables. The fresh market was estimated to be around R 77.2 billion, the dry market was at R 63.7 billion, beverage was at R 42.4 billion and perishables were at R 30.3 billion. With regard to small business development, Massmart was committed to spending R 200 million on the development of small suppliers, and to identifying small suppliers and facilitating their access to opportunities within the Massmart supply chain, focusing on consumer demand based opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Massmart&rsquo;s focus was on identifying small and medium suppliers with a maximum turnover of around R 50 million, giving preference to women-owned and black-owned enterprises, with a strong emphasis on manufacturing. Massmart disbursed funding through: non-recovery grants for equipment, machinery and factory improvements; secured loans via guarantees to commercial lenders; and technical assistance, agricultural extension services, product safety and quality compliance, financial training and brand development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Massmart was organized into five manufacturing clusters; processed foods, clothing and textiles, general linkages, building materials and bricks. Massmart also had a direct farm programme where it worked with small and medium farmers for supplies &ndash; Korema Farm supplied Massmart with cucumbers and peppers, African Ambition supplied tomatoes, Inqolobane Yobumbano supplied vegetable crops, Mnothopansi Cooperative supplied butternut and cabbage, Lebapankwe Trading supplied green peppers and Themba Beef supplied beef. Massmart operated in all provinces except for the Northern Cape. With regard to gender representation, in farming Massmart worked with 55% of farms owned by males and 54% owned by women, in manufacturing 67% was with males and 33% with women owned cooperatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He explained that some of the challenges experienced by the farming sector were:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;Under-developed infrastructure</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;Low crop diversity</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;Low production volumes (unreliable supply)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;High reliance on open field vegetable crops</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the manufacturing sector the challenges were:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;Viewing the retailer rather than the consumer as the end customer</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;Difficulty navigating compliance environment</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;Struggling to achieve viable economic scale within financial constraints</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;Insufficient expertise to ensure on-going productivity improvement</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He indicated that Massmart was learning to provide small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) with support in categories in which Massmart was excelling, such as home improvements and the processing of dry foods, Massmart was also focusing on providing support that contributed to sustainable prices and productivity advantage and ensuring post-listing marketing and brand building support. Moving forward, Massmart was looking to prioritize more manufacturing and less farming and was looking to optimize private label opportunities, focusing on import substitution opportunities and deepening compliance and in-store support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Presentation: Korema Farm</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Kobela Mokgohloa, Owner/ Managing Director, Korema Farms, provided a background to the business. The business was registered in 1995 as a Close Corporate; in 2004 Korema Farms was established as a cooperative. The farm employed 17 people and its main produce was cucumbers, peppers and tomatoes. Korema supplied mainly the Pretoria and Johannesburg markets. In 2012 Korema grew from having seven tunnels to having 15 tunnels. Some of the achievements of the business were that the Owner received the &ldquo;Young farmer of the year&rdquo; award for three consecutive years (2012, 2013, and 2014) and the business was also recognized by the National Youth Development Agency (NYDA) as one of the fastest growing farmers in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Korema farms produced 28 266 boxes of cucumbers annually, 25 539 packs of peppers per cycle, 25% of these were robot peppers, 15% were red and yellow peppers and 60% were green peppers. Some of the challenges experienced by Korema farms were:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;High interest rates at banks</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;Lack of appropriate funding (blanket approach), as some departments provided Korema with equipment and machinery the farm did not need</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;Lack of a competitive edge around technology</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;Low demand for proudly South African products</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of these challenges were however being improved upon, for example the Department of Trade and Industry had an agricultural subsidy for cooperatives. Korema farm was also committed to motivating and educating other young people on how to access the market and how to succeed in the farming industry. He suggested that instead of government focusing on finding new farmers more focus and support should be given to the existing small farmers such as Korema farms. Korema farms was also involved in school feeding schemes. The biggest challenge was that of late payments, instead of payments being made within the 30 days indicated by government, some payments were made 60 and 90 days after they were due and this caused serious problems for the farm. One challenge was that they could only employ workers on a temporary basis due to the unreliable flow of income. He indicated that Korema farms had a 15 year plan which included the extension of the pack house, building more structures for production, purchasing additional truck, gaining market share and building a solid relationship with the client.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Presentation: Tiger Brands</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Sithembile Ngobese, Manager, Tiger Brand, thanked the Chairperson for the invitation. She indicated that Tiger Brands was headquartered in South Africa and was among the 40 Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) listed companies. The company held number one or two in most categories, spread across a wide range of food, home care, personal care and baby products. Tiger Brands manufactured in more than 50 manufacturing sites across the country and it also had footprints in Nigeria, Cameroon, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Ethopia, Chile and Peru. With regard to turnover and growth, in September 2013 the company&rsquo;s turnover was R 27 billion, in September 2014 the turnover was R 30.1 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With regard to enterprise and development model, Tiger Brands was committed to:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;Prioritizing ESD on selected large scale agricultural expenditure categories</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;Leveraging procurement with strategic suppliers to form an ESD investment community</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;Partnering with rural communities to establish farming cooperatives for critical mass</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;Partnering with government and relevant stakeholders for financing, support and mentorship</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;Focusing on consumer driven niche crops such as non-GM maize and Soya</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tiger Brands would be signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) to formalize activities and mutual support, Tiger Brands would also partner on new candidate projects aligned to DAFF priority crops and Tiger&rsquo;s send in these areas. The company would also partner with the Gauteng Economic Development on the Township Spaza shop programme. Tiger Brands currently procured about 30 000 tons of sunflower oil per annum from oil converters in South Africa. This procurement amounted to about R 340 million per annum. Depending on prevailing local and international sunflower seed and oil markets, Tiger requested converters to import crude sunflower oil from Argentina or the Black Sea and refine it locally. Tiger Brands would consider partnering with Wilmar Continental to empower rural communities to be sustainable farmers of sunflower and maize. Wilmar Continental secured partnership agreements with tribal land owners to beneficiate arable land in the Free State and in KwaZulu Natal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With regards to social impact, Tiger Brands had established a foundation which fed breakfast at schools in collaboration with the Department of Basic Education, to complement the National School Nutrition Program. Over 40 000 learners benefitted from this program daily across 62 schools, over 41 879 learners benefitted from the Nutrition Education Programme. Tiger Brands served 12 million meals annually and provided 107 000 food parcels a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Discussions:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson said South Africa had a 30% policy for procurement for SMMEs and Cooperatives. This applied both to the private and public sector. The aim of the meeting was so that Massmart and Tiger Brands could indicate to the Committee the size of the market they occupied, and whether 30% of that market share was reserved for SMMEs and Cooperatives. How much did Tiger Brands buy from small farmers? There needed to be full implementation of the 30% policy. How were the imports being replaced with locally produced goods and products? She argued that black people, who were the original South Africans, needed to become a huge part of the main traders and not just remain consumers. Whites were still the majority of the traders and this needed to be transformed radically. South Africa needed to strive for an inclusive economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr T Mhlongo (DA) raised a concern that the Chairperson had been talking since the meeting started. Why were other Members invited if they would not be given a change to engage the presentations?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson responded that she was simply reminding the Committee about how the meeting started before she opened up the floor for discussions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr P Mnguni (ANC) said the meaning of cooperative needed to be re-looked at. Cooperatives were not an option for capitalist aspirations. He said the presentations would have been more meaningful if they had given a racial breakdown and gender representation of the industry according to market share. He indicated that high prices being charged to new farmers was also a concern, there were allegations that small farmers could not set their own prices, they produced the goods but prices were determined elsewhere. This needed to be addressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr E Nchabeleng (ANC) asked what made an entity a cooperative, was it simply a change of name? He raised a concern that there were once very good cooperatives within the country but all these have since disappeared. He indicated that Massmart had been accused of predatory pricing in a number of cases, was there any truth in such allegations? There were allegations that when Massmart entered a country the company drastically lowered its prices forcing out competition in the area. When competition had been sufficiently forced out of the market, Massmart raised its prices again to recover whatever the loss had been. With regard to Tiger Brands&rsquo; school feeding programme he asked whether there was any way the company was monitoring the nutritional benefits of the food being given to the children. Was the food providing balanced meals to the children?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms P Ngwenya-Mabila (ANC) asked whether both Tiger Brands and Massmart kept records of their suppliers in some form of a database. What kind of contracts were there between Massmart and local suppliers? With regards to food security, she said one of the presentations indicated that the focus would move away from farming towards manufacturing, what was the reason for this? She asked Korema farms to give an indication of the number of members the cooperative had, what was the gender breakdown? What impact had the cooperative had on the lives of the community members? How many seasonal workers did the farm employ? With regards to the funding and equipment which Korema farms received from departments but was not needed, were the departments not supplying the cooperative with needs based on a business plan? What was Korema farm&rsquo;s profit per year?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn thanked the Chairperson for the organising the joint meeting because government&rsquo;s biggest problem was that the departments were working in silos. This was an issue which parliament needed to try and fix to avoid duplication of work. The Committee visited two Massmart plantations in the Eastern Cape and they were both not functional because there was no market for their products. She said SMME and cooperative development was starting from the wrong side, there should first be a market for a product before putting up a farm. Black farmers were struggling to get funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr M Walters (DA) said the Committee was not a tribunal. The presentations were only examples of what could be done to improve the markets. Going forward the small business sector should be analysed to see how it could be expanded to include more commodities. Why was South Africa importing sunflower oil when sunflowers were being produced in the country? Parliament needed to be engaged to organize more engagements between the Committees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr A Madella (ANC) congratulated Korema farms on the good work that they were doing, especially because it was a young farm owned by a young black man. What were Tiger Brands and Massmart doing to include SMMEs and Cooperatives owned and run by disabled people in their supply chain?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson indicated that the topic of SMME and Cooperative development was a very interesting one, and the attendance showed that there needed to be more discussions on the matter. However, due to time constraints, all remaining questions which Members had should be submitted to the Committee in writing and Tiger Brands and Massmart would then respond to those questions. A follow up meeting would be organized and the relevant information would be made available to the respective Committees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Leroni responded to the question on predatory pricing and said South Africa had a Competition Commission who was very alert to that kind of behavior, and made it a point to pick it up very quickly. Also, predatory pricing happened in a situation where one retailer was incredibly dominant over the others. The South African retail industry was very developed in this regard and had very strong competition which included a variety of retailers. It was therefore not possible for a retailer to lower prices in such a way that other competitors were pushed out of the market. When Walmart came into the country there was concern that there would be a lot of imports but this has not happened. Regarding the statistics he said every business in South Africa was under incredible scrutiny, the Competition Commission reported on all the runnings of every registered company. Massmart would make a summary of the report available to the Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Massmart had not looked at the including disabled suppliers specifically into their company but work would be done to change this. He asked the Committee to refer Massmart to Cooperatives which were owned and run by disabled people. Massmart worked closely with the Department of Economic Development, the Department helped Massmart identify businesses and opportunities which Massmart could work with. He agreed with the Chairperson that the industry needed to be transformed to include more black people in the supply chain. Massmart had procured R 160 million of goods from its suppliers. Retail was only one part of the industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Ngobese said there was a need for government to work more closely with the private sector, however one of the things which came up in Tiger Brands&rsquo; work in uplifting townships was that most of the shops in the townships were being rented out by government to other nationals, making it very difficult for Tiger Brands to provide support. With regard to the nutritional content of the school feeding programme, Tiger Brands was working with some universities who went about to check up on the introduction of the programmes. The food Tiger Brands gave was food recommended by nutritionalists. The import of sunflower oil was one of the issues Tiger Brands was concerned about, and this was going to be one of the projects which Tiger Brands would be collaborating with the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries on in the Free State.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson thanked Members from all the Committees who attended the meeting, together with the representatives from Tiger Brands and Massmart. The joint Committees needed to organize a workshop which would include the Portfolio Committee on Transport. Farms needed to be more accessible. The lack of technology in farming was also another matter which needed to be improved. She said the Portfolio Committee on Small Business Development would compile a report on the proceedings of the meeting, which would inform the work of the joint meeting going forward. People were producing things which were not actually needed by the market and this needed to be addressed, support services were also not in line with what was needed. The individual Committees also needed to go back and prepare their inputs for the workshop. The Committee also needed to have a targeted approach in signing the transversal agreements. A tailor made funding model for small businesses was also necessary because each business required funding which was informed by its business model. The joint meeting however was a very good starting point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The meeting was adjourned.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "summary": "<p>The Portfolio Committee on Social Development invited the Portfolio Committee on Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, the Portfolio Committee on Rural Development and Land Reform, the Portfolio Committee on Social Development and the Portfolio Committee on Basic Education to a briefing by the retail industry on access to the market and value chain for small medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) and Cooperatives. Ten stakeholders from the retail sector were invited to participate in the discussions but only four responded, Tiger Brands and Massmart were the only two who were able to attend the meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a presentation by Massmart the food market was divided into the fresh market, dry groceries market, the beverage market and perishables. The fresh market was estimated to be around R 77.2 billion, the dry market was at R 63.7 billion, beverage was at R 42.4 billion and perishables were at R 30.3 billion. With regard to small business development, Massmart was committed to spending R 200 million on the development of small suppliers. Massmart was committed to identifying small suppliers and facilitating their access to opportunities within the Massmart supply chain, focusing on consumer demand based opportunities. Massmart&rsquo;s focus was on identifying small and medium suppliers with a maximum turnover of around R 50 million, giving preference to women-owned and black-owned enterprises, with a strong emphasis on manufacturing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the challenges experienced by the farming sector were: under-developed infrastructure, low crop diversity, low production volumes (unreliable supply) and high reliance on open field vegetable crops. In the manufacturing sector the challenges were viewing the retailer rather than the consumer as the end customer, difficulty navigating compliance environment, struggling to achieve viable economic scale within financial constraints, and insufficient expertise to ensure on-going productivity improvement. Massmart was looking to prioritize more manufacturing and less farming and was looking to optimize private label opportunities, focusing on import substitution opportunities and deepening compliance and in-store support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Korema Farm was a black-owned cooperative which was one of the biggest suppliers of cucumbers and peppers to Massmart. The farm employed 17 people and its main produce was cucumbers, peppers and tomatoes. Korema supplied mainly the Pretoria and Johannesburg markets. The Owner of Korema farms had been recognized as &ldquo;Young farmer of the year&rdquo; in three consecutive years (2012, 2013, 2014). Korema farms produced 28 266 boxes of cucumbers annually and 25 539 packs of peppers per cycle. Some of the challenges experienced by Korema farms were; high interest rates at banks, the lack of appropriate funding (blanket approach), some departments providing Korema with equipment and machinery the farm did not need, lack of competitive edge around technology and low demand for proudly South African products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Korema farms was also involved in school feeding schemes. The biggest challenge was that of late payments, instead of payments being made within the 30 days indicated by government, some payments were made 60 and 90 days after they were due and this caused serious problems for the farm. One challenge was that they could only employ workers on a temporary basis due to the unreliable flow of income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tiger Brands was headquartered in South Africa and was among the 40 Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) listed companies. The company held number one or two in most categories, spread across a wide range of food, home care, personal care and baby products. Tiger Brands manufactured in more than 50 manufacturing sites across the country and it also had footprints in Nigeria, Cameroon, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Ethopia, Chile and Peru. With regard to turnover and growth, in September 2013 the company&rsquo;s turnover was R 27 billion, in September 2014 the turnover was R 30.1 billion. Tiger Brands would be signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Department of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) to formalize activities and mutual support, Tiger Brands would also partner with on new candidate projects aligned to DAFF priority crops and Tiger&rsquo;s send in these areas. The company would also partner with the Gauteng Economic Development on the Township Spaza shop programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members thanked the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Small Business for putting together the joint meeting; they agreed that such an engagement was long overdue. Government departments were working in silos and this was a concern which Parliament needed to address. However because of time constraints, most Members were unable to ask questions but there was a suggestion that a workshop would be put together for all the respective Committees, and invitations would also be extended to other stakeholders within the small business and retail sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the questions Members were able to ask included: How much did Tiger Brands buy from small farmers? How were the imports being replaced with locally produced goods and products? What plans were there to radically transform the retail sector to include more black retailers? How did Massmart respond to the allegations around predatory pricing? What were the nutritional benefits of the school feeding programme? What kind of contracts were there between Massmart and local suppliers? What impact had the cooperative had on the lives of the community members? How many seasonal workers did the farm employ? What was Korema farm&rsquo;s profit per year?</p>\r\n",

        "body": "<p><strong>Briefing by Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Siphokazi Ndudane, Acting Deputy Director-General in Fisheries Management; DAFF, presented an overview of the draft Small-Scale Fisheries regulations. The 14 regulations were:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>This specifies who qualified to be a small-scale fisher.</li>\r\n\t<li>The purpose of the regulations: to ensure equitable access to fish by small-scale fishing communities; to recognise a multi-species approach in the granting of rights; to transform the inequalities of the past fisheries system; and to address poverty, food security and socio-economic development. It had been deliberated that co-operatives were the way to go. This regulation aimed to grant access to people who had been denied access deliberately.</li>\r\n\t<li>The identification, verification and registration of the fishers. It includes the process of expression of interest, and a small-scale fisher verification criterion would be used. The process of identifying the fishers had been distanced from the Department, hence the appointment of a service provider to do the identification and verification.</li>\r\n\t<li>This regulation looks at co-operatives and the granting of fishing rights. It states that the Minister determines the number of co-operatives and allocates to co-operatives that are registered in terms of the Co-operatives Act, 2005, and the Minister has to determine if it has to be a primary small-scale fisheries co-operative. This regulation provides for only verified small-scale fishers to be members of the co-operative and prohibits members of co-operatives to be owners of a commercial right. The duration of the right may not exceed 15 years. The regulation states that small-scale fishing rights can not be transferred and makes provision for access to a basket of species.</li>\r\n\t<li>This makes provision for additional members to be added to the co-operative after three years of awarding the small-scale fishing right to the co-operative. It also makes provision for the replacement of members to be considered in the case of death or resignation of existing members. Additional members must meet the criteria to be recognised as a small-scale fisher. The Minister is required to approve the amendments to co-operative membership.</li>\r\n\t<li>This regulation focuses on the fish processing establishment rights and secondary co-operatives. It states that only secondary co-operatives comprising two or more primary small-scale fisheries co-operatives are eligible to apply for a fish processing right. It also states that primary co-operatives must have 100% ownership of the secondary co-operative, and primary co-operatives would be allowed to store fish. However, the issue of fish storage was still being discussed to ensure they had the facilities that were required.</li>\r\n\t<li>Elements of the co-operative constitution and management plan are specified.</li>\r\n\t<li>This deals with certain powers and duties of co-operatives. By the second season, a primary co-operative that sells fish must be a member of at least one secondary co-operative. After the second season, a primary co-operative shall only sell fish to a secondary co-operative. The co-operatives may be the recipient of a transferred commercial fishing right. The co-operatives can employ the services of any person, if members of the co-operatives do not have the necessary skills.</li>\r\n\t<li>This focuses on the multi-species approach. The co-operatives are required to request initial access to a basket of species. The Minister has to approve species for own use and those for commercial use per co-operative. This regulation prescribes management measures for species&rsquo; utilization, including Total Allowable Catch (TAC) and Total Applied Effort (TAE). In the first year of allocation, the co-operatives are given first choice to agree on apportionment of the TAC and TAE between co-operatives in the same region. If there is no agreement reached, then the Minister would be required to determine the apportionment.</li>\r\n\t<li>This looks at small-scale fishing areas. It states that fishing areas would be established, based on the type of species required. The Minister may demarcate multiple fishing areas per co-operative. There had been a suggestion of municipal demarcation, but the fish did not know boundaries, so the issue was still to be looked at.</li>\r\n\t<li>It deals with the co-management of structures. The Minister is expected to establish local, regional and national co-management committees, and to appoint members. The committees are required to share the responsibility in the management of resources. The committees would be composed of small-scale fisher members, government officials and affected parties. The appointment would be for a maximum of three years.</li>\r\n\t<li>This regulation is about a conflict resolution mechanism. Internal conflict is to be dealt with by following the co-operatives&rsquo; internal dispute resolution mechanism. The Minister is not responsible to resolve internal disputes, but may facilitate mediation and arbitration proceedings for a conflict between a small-scale co-operative and a third party.</li>\r\n\t<li>It deals with compliance. The constitution of co-operatives has to specify actions to be taken against members that contravene provisions of the Marine Living Resources Act (MLRA). The Director-General has to be informed of such action taken.</li>\r\n\t<li>The constitution is an important document that governs the functioning of the co-operative. It also explains what members can and can not do within the entity. By prescribing a constitution template, all co-operatives would have to use the same template. The constitution was based on other constitutional models that were currently used for co-operatives. The template had been tailored to address small-scale fisheries matters.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Some points to note were that only verified small-scale fishers could be members of the co-operative; no shareholding of members was applicable; by-laws needed to specify the conflict resolution mechanisms, the division of labour, remuneration of work, distribution of profits, utilisation of species, marketing plan, and the involvement of women, youth and people with disabilities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLastly, in the process of finalising regulations, the draft regulations had been published on 6 March 2015 and hadbeen uploaded on the website of the Department. Translated versions in isiXhosa, Afrikaans and isiZulu had also been uploaded on the website. The public had had 30 days from the time of publication to comment on the draft regulations. Road shows to explain the regulations to stakeholders had been conducted between 16 and 23 March. The Minister had then invited a second round of comments on 28 April. All the comments received and associated responses would be recorded. Comments that were accepted would be incorporated in the final Regulations. The Minister would be required to approve the final Regulations. It was envisaged that the MLRA Amendment Act and Final Regulations would be promulgated on 31 July 2015.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Discussion</em><br />\r\nMs Z Jongbloed (DA) asked the Department to provide evidence showing that the attendees of workshops held in 2014 regarding the small-scale fisheries programme had made comments and had been fully informed about the process. She wanted to find out if the Department had considered the fact that there were not enough fish in the ocean, and that this would hinder achieving equitable access. She further enquired if the Department was able to deliver on its core mandate, considering its lack of capacity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Ndudane said that the evidence requested would be provided to the Committee. It had not been in all places visited that people had felt they did not understand what the small-scale fisheries programme was all about. Department officials were currently compiling the comments &ndash; the ones that were going to be taken into consideration -- but not all comments would be documented. Concerning the issue of insufficient fish in the ocean, she reported that the Fisheries Branch of the Department monitored 22 commercial fisheries. Of the 22, four were of interest to small-scale fisheries. It was expensive to go deep into the ocean for a number of days, and the four commercial fisheries were not expensive. The 18 remaining sectors were available.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe highlighted that deep-sea fishing was for profit making to ensure that the big companies remained sustainable. It was the responsibility of the Department to ensure there was fishing for future generations. Maintaining a sustainable fisheries management was not easy when one had to make sure there was enough fish in the ocean, while allowing people to fish for consumption. This was a global phenomenon.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Mortimer Mannya, Deputy Director: Food Security and Agrarian Reform, DAFF, admitted they were limited in terms of capacity within the Fisheries Division but they were making sure they were carrying out their mandate with their little resources while the Division was still negotiating with the Treasury. The Fisheries Division was continuing to do its work with organisations it was in partnership with.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr C Maxegwana (ANC) remarked that the Fisheries Division of DAFF was complex. The Department needed to improve the work of people in that Division and let the Committee know about the skills that were available and unavailable. He wanted to establish how effective the round of consulting people had been, because he had not heard mention of traditional leaders, and if the consultation process continued not to be done properly, people would be left not knowing what to do. He further wanted to know if the three years within the fifteen years granted to co-operatives for fishing rights, was meant for piloting. He asked for clarity on the difference between a primary and a secondary co-operative.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Ndudane responded that the process consultation had not been done to the maximum. Consultation with traditional leaders had not taken place. When work had been started in 2007, the emphasis had been about the setting up of co-operatives for fishing rights. That was why the Department had appointed a service provider to help in the registration of small-scale fishers. The service provider was going to work with the communities, not a community representative who was going to decide on <em>bona fide</em> fishers. It was the community that was going to know who the <em>bona fide</em> fisher was. She indicated that civil servants did not want to go out and see the conditions on the ground, and that resulted in poor communication with the communities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nReferring to the three years within the 15-year period of fishing rights, she said that the three year period was a pilot period to ensure things went well during that phase so that the co-operative could continue. However, if things did not work out during this three-year period, then intervention would take place. On the difference between the primary and secondary co-operatives, she explained that the primary co-operative were comprised fishermen. They did the catching, then a secondary co-operative processed the catch.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe highlighted that window-dressing was huge in the fishing industry and those who were practising it knew the Department was not going to do anything about it. That was why fishermen in the primary co-operative were going to be registered as 100% owners, and they would have a seat in the secondary co-operatives, which processed the catches<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr T Ramokhoase (ANC) wanted to find out about the form of consultation that took place, because this programme was about empowering people at grassroots level. He enquired what the plan for monitoring and evaluation was.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Ndudane responded that consultation had been in the form of <em>imbizos,</em> from the Northern Cape to KwaZulu-Natal. People who spoke languages spoken in those areas were deployed. Participants commented in their own languages. The <em>imbizos</em> done so far may not have beeen optimal, but follow-ups would be done to make sure people understood the value of the products they fished. On monitoring and evaluation, she said there was no plan as yet. The Department was in the process of developing the plan with the Department of Trade and Industry (dti) in order to monitor the catches. As part of the plan, there was a software tool that was being developed to monitor catches by co-operatives accurately.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs A Steyn (DA) asked why the Act was being amended again. She also asked if people were informed about what a co-operative was and how it was run, and wanted to find out if people understood what TAC (Total Allowable Catch) meant.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Mannya, explaining why the Act was being amended again, indicated that the MLRA Amendment Act was a piece of legislation that had been amended but was awaiting the finalisation of regulations so that it was promulgated.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Ndudane said that training people about the workings of a co-operative still remained a challenge, because people needed skills in bookkeeping and banking. The Department of Small Business Development (DSBD) and the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) had expressed interest in helping, but had not committed funding. The DAFF had committed a sum of R10 million. Regarding the TAC, she said there had not been a clear guideline on this matter because if it was left to communities to decide on how much they could catch, it would lead to endless fights. That was why the final decision for now lay with the Minister if communities could not reach an agreement.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Z Mandela (ANC) commented that it was important that people at grassroots level were empowered about the value of the products they fished. He said that he was recently sold a dozen of lobsters by a street vendor in Port St Johns for R200, whereas two lobsters in a restaurant were selling for R200.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson asked for clarity about the public participation process that had happened at Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife, because Mr Mannya and Ms Ndudane had visited the area but had never said a word to the community. She also asked why the Northern Cape was not mentioned in the programme.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Mannya responded they had visited Ezemvelo in order to review the contracts the Department had got with it, because Ezemvelo was an agent in monitoring and surveillance. It facilitated small-scale fisheries and conducted research. Because it employed a number of people, the visit had been necessary to determine what would be done when the contracts were not renewed, so that job creation could continue. Traditional leaders were not consulted. The matter was still under discussion. Concerning the Northern Cape, the province was included in the programme because it abutted a portion of the ocean.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Ramokhoase wanted to find out why there was always in-fighting between community members when allocation rights had been granted. He also wanted to know what happened when the small-scale fisher (co-operative) grows big.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Ndudane said the in-fighting was caused by marketers. They looked at the tonnage and estimated the value. They then gave the community an advance -- for example, R300 000. When that money did not get shared equitably, the fight started. On small-scale fishers becoming big, she informed the Committee there was nothing like a small-scale fishery or commercial fisher. Fishing was commercial &ndash; period! Even if it was for recreational purposes, that fish could be sold. The difference lay in the scale. The desired output of the government was to have the small-scale graduate become big, not to remain small forever. The right to fish was granted for a particular period. The small-scale could grow big and get fishing rights provided it was time for allocations, or the right of another fisher had been revoked.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson enquired if the R10 million the Department had set aside was for training or for the implementation of the entire small-scale fisheries programme.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Ndudane said that the R10 million was for the implementation of the plan for only one year &ndash; this current financial year. Each financial period was going to have its own allocation. The DTI and DSBD were going to make their own allocations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Jongbloed wanted to establish what was going to happen to already existing co-operatives, seeing that new ones were going to be introduced. How would the Department avoid the recurrence of the same mistakes, seeing that the consultation process had not been successful because of shortcomings? Lastly, she wanted to know what the basket of species was going to look like.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Ndudane said the existing co-operatives were not going to be null and void. They had to be modified to suit the criteria of the Department, but if they did not, they would be disbanded. Concerning evading past mistakes, she said that live comments had been received and had been incorporated into the report that was being compiled. The Department had got an idea of what the basket of species was going to look like, but it was going to be guided by what was available in a particular area because the oceans were diverse and contained different species. The list would be sent to the Committee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe meeting was adjourned.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "summary": "<p>Window-dressing was huge in the fishing industry, and those who were practising it knew the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) was not going to do anything about it. That was why fishermen in the primary co-operatives were going to be registered as 100% owners, and they would have a seat in the secondary co-operatives, which processed the catches. This is what the Portfolio Committee heard when the DAFF tabled its overview of the draft Small-scale Fisheries regulations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Committee learnt that the purpose of the proposed regulations was to ensure equitable access to fish by small-scale fishing communities; to recognise a multi-species approach in the granting of rights to small-scale fisheries; to transform the inequalities of the past fisheries system; and to address the high levels of abject poverty, socio-economic development and food insecurity in the small-scale fishing communities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Office of the Chief State Law Advisor had vetted the draft regulations and minor amendments had been incorporated into the final draft. The Marine Living Resources Act (MLRA) Amendment Act could be promulgated only once the regulations had been prescribed to address certain matters contained in section 19. The regulations empowered the Minister to identify, verify, register and recognise both small-scale fishers and small-scale fishing communities. The verification of individual fishers would be done in consultation with the fishing community.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConcerning co-operatives, fishing rights and fish processing establishments, the Minister would determine the number of allowed co-operatives to operate per fishing zone, based on fish sustainability and fishing practices. Co-operatives would be in two forms &ndash; a primary co-operative and a secondary one. The primary co-operative would be involved in fishing operations while the secondary one would deal with processing and market access. The primary co-operative was the only one that was eligible to apply for a small-scale fishing right, and the secondary co-operative could not operate without being issued with a fish processing establishment right.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRegarding the multi-species approach, the Minister was compelled to approve the list and quantity of fish species to be allocated for own consumption and commercial purposes, after consulting the fishing community. The Minister could intervene in the apportionment of the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) and Total Applied Effort (TAE) only when co-operatives failed to reach agreement. The Minister may also increase the basket composition and quantity after a request to do so by the small-scale fishing community.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Small-scale Fisheries policy stated clearly that the co-management structure would be made up of officials of the Department, the conservation authority and small-scale fishers. The regulations provided a constitutional template that could be used by co-operatives when drawing up their own constitutions. The draft constitution covered important functions, such as membership roles and responsibilities, the liability of members, conditions and processes for termination of membership, management of co-operatives, general meetings, financial management, and amendment of the constitution governing co-operatives.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMembers asked the Department to provide evidence showing that the attendees of workshops held in 2014 regarding the small-scale fisheries programme had made comments and had been fully informed about the process. They wanted to find out if the Department had considered the fact that there was not enough fish in the ocean and that would hinder achieving equitable access. They wanted to establish how effective the round of consulting people had been because they had not heard a mention of traditional leaders, and if the consultation process had not been done properly, people would be left not knowing what to do. The DAFF was asked if people were informed about what a co-operative was and how it was run, and why there was always in-fighting between community members when allocation rights had been granted.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

They may investigate any matter of public interest that falls within their area of responsibility. There is a Portfolio Committee for each national Ministry and its associated government department/s.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Select Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Council of Provinces (NCOP) appoints from its permanent members a number of Select Committees to shadow the work of the various national government departments and to deal with Bills.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause only 54 of the 90 NCOP Members are permanent delegates compared to the 400 of the NA, the Select Committees oversee the work of more than one national government department.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Public Accounts Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Assembly Standing Committee on Public Accounts acts as Parliament&#39;s watchdog over the way taxpayers&#39; money is spent by the Executive. Every year the Auditor-General tables reports on the accounts and financial management of the various government departments and State institutions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHeads of government departments and institutions are regularly called by this committee to report and account for expenditure. The Committee can recommend that the National Assembly takes corrective actions if necessary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Members&#39; Legislative Proposals and Petitions Committees</strong><br />\r\nDraft bills can be submitted by individual Members of the National Assembly. These bills are considered by the National Assembly&#39;s Standing Committee on Private Member&#39;s Legislative Proposals and Special Petitions. If the Committee agrees with the principle of the draft Bill, a Bill will be prepared and dealt with by Parliament.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe National Council of Provinces Select Committee on Members&#39; and Provincial Legislative Proposals considers draft Bills from individual NCOP members and provincial legislatures.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPetitions may also be tabled in Parliament and referred to the relevant committee that deals with the issue raised in the petition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Internal Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Assembly has a number of internal committees that deal with matters affecting the running of Parliament. The Committees normally consist of senior Members of Parliament. The Rules Committee and its sub-committees deal with House rules, the budget of the House, support for Members, internal arrangements, and powers and privileges of members. Other internal Committees are the Programme Committee that plans the work of the Assembly, the Disciplinary Committee, and the Committee of Chairpersons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe National Council of Provinces has its own domestic Committees. The Rules Committee and its subcommittees deal with the NCOP rules, the NCOP budget, parliamentary privileges, internal arrangements, international relations and delegated legislation. The Programme Committee plans the work of the NCOP and the Committee of Chairpersons make recommendations about the functioning of Committees and other NCOP forums.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Ad hoc Committees</strong><br />\r\nParliament or one of its Houses may appoint an ad hoc (temporary) Committee when a special task must be done.

        "body": "<p>The Chairperson said that in terms of the National Assembly rule 249, the Committee could go back to the National Assembly (NA) to request permission to look into the other provisions of the Principal Act because the Proposed Amendment Bill did not deal with certain sections of the Principal Act. These were sections 7, 8 and 4. A letter had been circulated that the NA, in terms of the rules of Parliament, allowed the Committee to look into those mentioned provisions not covered by the proposed amendment Bill. Before the actual deliberations on the PAPA Bill could commence, the Committee first had to deliberate on this additional requirement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr M Filtane (UDM) asked whether the deadline for this Bill, which was 12 July, would be met.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson responded that the Committee had to do thorough work and could not send a Bill that was in question to the NA. The Department may have to ask for an extension again. An unfinished product could not be taken back to the NA because of the Constitutional judgement passed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms A Steyn (DA) said that the Committee had to do that, as that was one of the concerns she had with the Department at the beginning. She had got the impression it had been a rushed job just to get the Constitutional Court issue off their hands. There had even been a discussion when the Committee started, on the purpose of the Bill and she had anticipated that the Committee would run into trouble. The Principal Act had been enacted in 1935 and needed material changes, as a couple of wording changes would not suffice. The NA needed to be approached and certain changes would be needed to the Principal Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson asked if the Members agreed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Members agreed to the request in terms of NA rule 249.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson said that it would be presented to the NA next week. It was felt that the Committee should not wait, and therefore continue its deliberations on the Bill. The State Law Advisor was then given an opportunity to present.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Advocate Yolande van Aswegen, State Law Advisor, described what she had done since the last meeting on Tuesday. All of the comments, made mostly by the stakeholders, had been incorporated into the PAPA Bill working document by way of comments on the side of the Bill, so that Members could see how the amendments would look if they were incorporated into the Bill. Today the proposals made by Committee members on Tuesday would be incorporated into the Bill. She asked whether the whole Bill should be run through, even where there had been no comments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn asked if everything could be gone through, as there were certain issues that she wanted to raise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr T Ramokhoase (ANC) said that without pushing aside the proposal, the Committee also had to be cautious of issues always coming up which had been dealt with in previous meetings. This did not allow for progress, as these issues then had to be dealt with first, and it was double time consuming. If issues which had been agreed upon on Tuesday came up, he would have a big problem with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson laid out what would happen in today&rsquo;s meeting. The State Law Advisor would present what they had and if Members felt that there were certain things that needed to be discussed, they should do so. It was not about individual Members&rsquo; view of what needed to be in the Bill, but rather the collective agreement of the Committee of what should be in the Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Advocate Van Aswegan went through the proposed Bill working document and the incorporation of comments made in Tuesday&rsquo;s deliberations. Clause one was the repeal of section 2, with no changes. Clause 2 repealed section 3, with no changes. There was also the insertion of sections 3A up to 3P, which was proposed by a Member that related to appeals, after the licensing procedure, for the sake of logical sequence. The right to appeal was now section 3M and followed after the issue of licences in section 3L -- this was an insertion of what used to be 11B, so therefore there was not much change in regard to the contents of those sections, but merely their locations in the Bill. Section 3A, which dealt with the designation of the National Licensing Officer (NLO) had no changes. 3B, the qualification of the NLO, had no changes. 3C had no changes. 3D on the appointment of experts, still stayed the same. 3E on the delegation of powers and functions, stayed the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With regard to section 3F, there was a proposal by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA) to insert as one of the requirements for the application of licences, that a &ldquo;description should be provided as to where the animal comes from and whether the animal would travel&rdquo;. This had not been included as it, and the wording of it, should be discussed and had therefore been flagged in Tuesday&rsquo;s meeting. 3G on the duration of licences, stayed the same. In section 3H, on the considering and granting of applications for licences by the NLO, one should note that there had been the insertion of a proposed section 3H (2) which provided that &ldquo;the NLO must consider and decide on an application within 45 days after receipt of the application&rdquo;. This section had been inserted because there had been a comment made by a Member to ensure that the NLO had a specific timeframe within which to consider and decide on application. Section 3I, which dealt with the hearing of applications had stayed the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With regard to section 3J on the issuing of licences, there had been a minor change which had been made based on a comment of a Member, and which the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) had also agreed to. The maximum period allowed for the NLO to inform an applicant for the decision in respect of an application, had been reduced from 21 days to seven days. Section 3J now read that &ldquo;the NLO must within 7 days after making a decision, inform the applicant in writing of the granting, refusal or amendment of a licence and notify the applicant of the date, time and place of collection of such licence&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On section 3K, which deals with the suspension, withdrawal or amendment of license; subsection 3K(3) had now been inserted to ensure that the applicant did not continue with the exhibition, training etc. of an animal, without a valid licence or after the licence had expired. The inserted section 3K(3) provided that &ldquo;if a licence was refused, an applicant must cease the training, exhibition or use of animals for safeguarding&rdquo;. The Committee, however, still had to decide on the above mentioned provision. Section 3L on the validity of licences saw no changes. Section 3M and the subsequent sections dealt with the right to appeal and nothing with regard to the content thereof had changed, but for it shifting to after section 3L.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term &ldquo;dogs&rdquo; had also been inserted throughout the Bill and as a consequence there had been some subsequent amendments that were not necessarily reflected in the previous Bill that had been presented on Tuesday, but had now been incorporated into the Bill today so that Members could see how the Bill would look. One of these was section 4 of the Principal Act. In order to change the reference within the correct context from &ldquo;dog&rdquo; to &ldquo;animal,&rdquo; section 4 dealt with the right of entry which had a lot of references to &ldquo;dogs,&rdquo; and these had now been changed to &ldquo;animals&rdquo;, as in sections 4(a), (b) and (c).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clause 5 dealt with the amendment of section 7 of the Principal Act, which referred to the Minister creating regulations on certain issues within the Act. The bold brackets here related to the omissions. The word &ldquo;Certificates&rdquo; had had to be removed consequently, because it related to sections 2 and 3 that were being repealed in this Bill, and the references to the renewal thereof had also been removed as a result. Clause 6 was the amendment of section 8 and nothing had changed since Tuesday&rsquo;s meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clause 7 amended section 11A of the Act, which dealt with the definitions. The definition of an &ldquo;Animal Scientist&rdquo; had been included, and now read as &ldquo; a person registered as a professional or certified natural scientist in the field of Animal Science in terms of section 20(3) of the Natural Scientific Professions Act&rdquo;. There had also been the consequential removal of the definition of &ldquo;certificate&rdquo; from the definitions because &ldquo;certificate&rdquo;, as used in section 7 of the Principal Act, had been replaced with the word &ldquo;licence&rdquo;. In section 7F of the Bill, which dealt with the use of safeguarding, the reference to &ldquo;dog&rdquo; had been replaced with the word &ldquo;animal&rdquo;. There was also a general amendment in the new clause 8 which dealt with certain expressions within the Act. It was a necessary clause to change all the references that had been made throughout to the word &ldquo;dogs,&rdquo; to &ldquo;animals&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Desiree Swartz, Parliamentary Legal Advisor, said that the Act nullified sections 2 and 3 of the Principal Act. Sections 2 and 3 dealt with the certificates and licences being issued by the magistrate. She would be dealing with a document that was headed as Clause 5, and had looked at this because she was concerned about what would happen when the Act came into operation to the licences and certificates that were already there. If one just repealed a section dealing with the authorisation in terms of which a person got the licence, then the licence of the said person was of no force and effect unless one had transitional arrangements, or some sort of retaining of the validity of some of the sections. This had been looked at, but the DAFF had not been consulted yet and still needed to give their views on it. The transitional arrangements she had looked at referred specifically to the certificates and licences. If one recalled the Constitutional Court judgment, the Court had held that it did not like the fact that a magistrate issued the certificates and licences. In the transitional arrangements, it also catered for anything done by a magistrate, and therefore anything that previously referred to the magistrates was now deemed to be done by the NLO. She had had to look at it, as one could not just say that it was still in terms of the repealed section, as the Court had specifically not been happy about it. That was why a deeming clause had been included, which provided that they would be issued by the NLO. This new clause, clause 11B would be inserted just after the Short Title. 11B(1) reads that &ldquo;licences issued in terms of the repealed Section 2, and a certificate in terms of the repealed section 3 of this Act, was deemed to have been issued in terms of section 3J of this Act and remains valid until the licence or certificate expires or was suspended, withdrawn or amended by the NLO&rdquo;. 11B(2) provides that &ldquo;anything done or decisions taken in terms of the repealed sections 2 and 3 of this Act was deemed to have been done or taken by the NLO&rdquo;. Section 11B(3) stipulates that &ldquo;any application for a licence or certificate made before the commencement of the Performing Animals Protection Amendment Act, 2015, must be processed by the NLO in accordance with any criteria contained in the repealed sections 2 and 3 of this Act&rdquo;. She then explained section 11B(3) and said that there may be applications which were currently pending and it would be unfair for those people with pending applications to reapply and start afresh with a new application. She suggested that these pending applications should be processed by the NLO and that the applications must meet the requirements that were in place when they had applied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Section 11B(4) read that &ldquo;any investigation conducted or criminal proceedings pending before a court before the commencement of the Performing Animals Protection Amendment Act, 2015, must be proceeded with and finalised as if sections 2 and 3 of this Act had not been repealed&rdquo;. In other words, if one was guilty of an offence or were being investigated for misconduct in terms of section 2 and 3, then the investigation had to continue. The Constitutional Court did not express a concern over the requirements of the issuing of licences but was rather only concerned about the separation of powers and giving the power to a magistrate. Therefore there was no harm in using the requirements in section 2 and 3 to complete the investigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Discussion</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson said that the Committee would focus on the highlighted changes to the Act, and asked if there were any objections to page 2 of the proposed Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn said that now that the Committee had the letter to the National Assembly, it made sense to her because the reason why the Committee had looked at other amending provisions of the Act had also been to ensure that the Committee looked at the animal welfare side of it, and she had felt that the Committee was not dealing with it. She had asked previously if the purpose of the Act could not be included, because there was a long title. If one included the purpose, it would ensure the welfare of animals was respected and protected in the course of exhibiting and training performing animals, and using animals for safeguarding. It would introduce a licensing system that offered protection for the welfare of animals and provide for sanctions for non-compliance. Animal welfare was also being dealt with in the Bill -- the Bill was not just dealing with licensing. If the licensing was just being dealt with, it would not be necessary to change other provisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson said she thought the Committee would agree that the issue of welfare needed a dialogue, because if the purpose clause was put in, exhibitions might not happen because of its interpretation in the Bill. The people who were going to use animals to perform needed to know what was expected of them and what could not be done in the training and other aspects. She thought that the Committee had agreed to give the DAFF six months to start the process and come back and give the Committee the framework/baseline in terms of the animal welfare. She gave an example, provided by Mr Filtane, which showed that whether an animal was distressed or not should be determined by an expert. Therefore the DAFF had to give a context to it. The Bill should not be put before the Court before it came into operation. The Bill was outdated. It was agreed that the Committee would comply, and had given a time frame of six months for the DAFF to bring in the dialogues that had been engaged with communities, so that the Bill could be pushed through to Parliament and the issue of animal welfare be dealt with in its entirety. The dialogues were needed as in some cultures people performed rituals with animals and this could not necessarily be considered animal abuse. Consensus therefore needed to be reached within society before the legislation could take place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr M Filtane (UDM) said that his take on what his colleague Ms Steyn had said about the Bill was related to the context in which it had been brought to the Committee. However, the animals&rsquo; welfare had to be taken into account wherever they were, even though this was not the main focus of the Bill. With all the discussions that had taken place, the Committee was pretty much covered. He agreed with the Chairperson that dealing with the welfare of the animals was an area that needed focused attention, and sufficient steps had been taken to make sure that they were well cared for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Ramokhoase said that the one thing that had come out of the meeting already was the agreement on the extension. The Committee should not ponder on things that had been mentioned over and over in the previous meetings and should rather focus on how the Committee could progress in the next phase. The legal team had been struggling to fit compliance into the Act, and said the Bill should look acceptable to the people that had sent it to the Committee. The legal team had been told at the Tuesday meeting to include the suggestions that had been agreed upon by the Committee, and no Member could say that they had failed to do so. All in all, there seemed to be agreement on the compliance matter before the Committee right now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn said that she was not trying to be difficult, and asked what the purpose would be of issuing licences if the welfare of the animals was not considered. Why was the Committee struggling with the licensing issue if the purpose was not also to ensure that the animals were being looked after? What was the reason for giving licences, when one could instead just make it possible for anyone to buy a licence and record it in a register? What was the reason, if it were not to protect and care for the animals?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson responded that the Animal Protection Act (APA) needed to be read with the PAPA. For now, the Committee had not looked into the APA to determine whether it did provide for the welfare of animals or not, in terms of its own understanding. The APA&rsquo;s intention was to protect animals, which could be inferred from the definition itself. Until now no one had opened a debate as to whether the APA needed to be repealed. The Committee was considering only the legislation dealing with performing animals. No Member had contested in the meetings that the APA did not cater for the welfare of animals. She said it was agreed that the PAPA Bill should not be read in isolation, but rather be read with the APA. She advised Ms Steyn that the Committee Members had decided not to agree with her proposal, but they would give her some time to motivate it and bring it up once more before the matter was closed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn said she accepted this ruling, and she would read the APA together with the PAPA Bill to see if it ensured that the welfare of animals was respected and protected in the exhibition and training of performing animals and the use of animals for safeguarding and to introduce a licensing system. She had not been speaking generally. The reason licences were given was indirectly to protect the animals and to ensure that the DAFF knew that the animals were being looked after.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Ramokhoase said he stood by the stance taken by the Chairperson. He had been happy with what the Committee had agreed upon on at the Tuesday meeting, and it was good to see that there was now some sort of direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn raised an issue with regard to section 3F (h) on the application for licence. She had previously asked for the description of the animal, and whether the animal would travel, among a few other aspects that had been added. The sections suggested by the NSPCA on page 4 of their presentation had not been included in the Bill. More specifically, the proposed insertions from the NSPCA that were not included were subsections (g), (h) and (i). This related to the age of the animal the person wanted to exhibit or train or use for safeguarding; the method and equipment used for control or restraint; and the methods and equipment used for training the animals intended for an exhibition or used for safeguarding. What she wanted was not in the Bill. She wanted a description of how the animal came to be in the vicinity or in possession of the applicant for training, performing, exhibiting or safeguarding, as well as whether the animal would be travelling regularly or continuously and the condition of travel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adv Van Aswegan responded that at the stage where the legal team had worked on the proposals again, she had not had access to the NSPCA&rsquo;s proposals. That was why they had been put into a comment in the document and highlighted so the Committee could discuss the correct wording to be used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Tembile Songabe, Director of Veterinary Public Health, DAFF said that the DAFF had looked at the input from the NSPCA, including the comment made by Ms Steyn. The DAFF was of the view that where the Bill dealt with ages and premises and so on, when one looked at 3F (2), it began to list all the descriptions that were wanted. The ages and living quarters of the animals were covered in 3F(2)(d), the description of the animal was covered in 3F(2)(a), and the question as to whether the animal would be travelling was also covered in section 3F(2)(b) and 3F(2)(c). That was the view of the DAFF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson asked the Members if they agreed that the proposal by the NSPCA would not be inserted, as it was already covered in the Act. The Members agreed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn said she agreed, as long as the person who was being issued a licence understood it like that. She was not happy that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in section 3F (3) had not been replaced with the word &ldquo;must&rdquo;. If the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; was used, a person could lie about the age of the animal in their application, if no one went and carried out an inspection. The DAFF could delegate their functions and therefore the person issuing the licence could delegate it to someone else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn then confessed that she was going off the point, but would like to take the opportunity to congratulate Dr Botlhe Modisane, Chief Director, Animal Production and Health: DAFF, on becoming the President of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), and on becoming a first time grandfather. The Chairperson and Members then congratulated Dr Modisane. The Chairperson said that she was planning on congratulating him in the House, as it was important for South Africans to know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Ramokhoase said the issue of &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;must&rdquo; had been deeply engaged upon, but ultimately the Committee had to understand that when it dealt with legislation it should sometimes not make it difficult for itself because of some other interest or aspect that was being looked at from another angle. It should be a balanced matter that would allow for both parties to have space so that progress could be made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson said she wanted to agree with what Ms Steyn had said, but she first wanted the DAFF lawyers and the Parliamentary lawyers to guide the Committee. From her experience, when &ldquo;may&rdquo; was used nothing usually got done because there was no instruction. As it was now past the 20th year of democracy in South Africa, it had now reached a point where the experience gained had to be used. She asked for advice on the issue from the DAFF and the Parliamentary legal advisors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr C Maxegwana (ANC) referred to Mr Filtane&rsquo;s suggestion that the issue should be conditionally accepted, and said that he did not want to accept conditions. He asked if the legal team advised that the word &ldquo;must&rdquo; should be used instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Songabe said the DAFF&rsquo;s view was that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; should be retained. The rationale behind the retention was that if one used the word &ldquo;must&rdquo;, it meant that before consideration of any license one would have to go there in person. The DAFF&rsquo;s view was that there could be certain circumstances where one would not need to, as a matter of principal &ndash; for instance, where one had already received all the information necessary to process that particular application. The DAFF&rsquo;s logistical and practical issue specifically related to the film industry, where they film animals from place to place, depending on the operational dynamics. It had been learnt that whenever one wanted to see where an animal was at any particular time of the day, one would not be able to do so. On the other hand, the provision 3(c)(1)(i) allowed for the NLO to seek any information from anyone who may be assisting the NLO in considering any applications. Therefore, the visiting of the premises did not necessarily have to be done when it was not necessary to do so. If the word &ldquo;must&rdquo; was used, it was implied that even if it did not have to be done, it now had to be done, even when there was adequate information in that regard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson responded that she did not agree with Dr Songabe. The work of the NLO should be to ensure that licences were given with regard to evidence received, and the state of the premises confirmed. That was also where the issue of welfare was coming in, and if the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; was used then the animals would not be protected. She asked for advice from the lawyers present.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Mooketsa Ramasodi, Chief Director, Inspections and Quarantine, asked if the DAFF lawyer could also be given an opportunity to give advice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson responded that the DAFF lawyer had been part of the Parliamentary legal team since the Tuesday meeting, and they had been instructed to work together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Kanthi Nagiah, Chief Director: Legal Services, DAFF said that what also should not be lost sight of in section 3 was the right to privacy. She had not looked into it fully, but for anyone to enter someone&rsquo;s premises, reasonable grounds to do so was required. The concern was that if it was an obligation that had to be performed in terms of the Act, then no other laws should be violated in entering the premises. Therefore caution should be taken in that respect, and any applicant could say that the NLO had been provided with copious amounts of information and all the requirements had been fulfilled, so what were the grounds for entering the person&rsquo;s premises? In addition, what also needed to be kept in mind were all the other prescripts that had been included in the Act to ensure that the application had enough information for there to be a desktop study, and to make a decision based on the information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson then said that it would be incorrect for an applicant to make an application and then to say that he wanted nobody to inspect his premises. She allowed the lawyers to respond on the issue of consent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Nagiah said that when one applied for a car licence, or any licence regarding one&rsquo;s home, it was not that one was inviting anyone to inspect one&rsquo;s home. As had been said earlier, she had not gone through it in detail, but that was her take on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Swartz responded to the question on the use of &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;must&rdquo; by saying that it was a policy decision which had been based on resources and the issues involved. When an application was made, one of the issues that would be looked at was to see whether the information given around the issue welfare was in fact true. That would have to be taken into account when one considered making it &ldquo;must&rdquo; or &ldquo;may&rdquo;. Her response to the issue of consent was that one could enter the premises only once the owner of the premises had given consent. If it was &ldquo;must&rdquo;, the NLO had to go and inspect. If the consent aspect was taken away, it would be unconstitutional and would need a warrant, but as it was written now it complied with all the requirements if one had to go on to a person&rsquo;s premises. The &ldquo;may&rdquo; does not relate to the consent, because the consent was in any event a requirement. The &ldquo;may&rdquo; would be important if one looked at whether it was practical for the NLO to go and inspect every situation, and this would be based on the resources of the DAFF. It did not matter whether &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;must&rdquo; was used but it would have an impact as to whether the provisions of the Act could be implemented properly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson said she agreed to the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; being retained, based on the lack of resources in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adv Van Aswegan added that when it came to the entering of premises for inspection, there were always two types of inspections that must be considered when dealing with legislation. The former was the regulatory one, as seen in the Bill, and the latter was the one which related to offences -- presuming someone had drugs on the premises -- which was the more serious one. Therefore, when dealing with the regulatory one, the consent angle was used because there were certain requirements a person must comply with in order to get a licence. That was the reason why consent was always built into the provisions, because issues were always raised on the right to privacy and if it was made a &ldquo;must&rdquo;, one would have to specify in the legislation a whole procedure about what the investigator should carry on him, the identification, what type of warrant could be issued and when. A warrant was also required only in very serious instances where one had a very strong suspicion that something was going wrong on those premises and which almost amounted to an offence. That was why the use of &ldquo;may&rdquo; had been advised, in order to stay away from the right to privacy issue, because it could be challenged in Court. As explained by the DAFF, it also gave the NLO leeway to inspect, where the NLO could make an appointment with the applicant and could go to the premises and inspect and see if the applicant was complying with the requirements or not. Basically, it was a condition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson asked if the item could be passed, and it was passed by the Members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Filtane had an issue with section 3H (1) and referred to the last word used, which was &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo;. There were two ways a person could be satisfied. He wished to have the &ldquo;satisfaction&rdquo; that had been referred to, to be qualified because one could be satisfied that he had been given all the information. The satisfaction had to come by way of &ldquo;the premises, accommodation, equipment and facilities that were utilised for the training, exhibition or performance of the animal were safe and would not cause harm to the animal&rdquo;. He then proposed that the condition of the animal should also be another requirement that needed to satisfy the NLO. The problem with being specific in legislation was that things that were not mentioned automatically became excluded. What would happen if the NLO raised something that had not been mentioned that he needed to be satisfied on? The applicant could say that the NLO had no authority to look at any other factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson responded that in section 3F, which dealt with the applications for licences, the issues which the Member had just proposed were covered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn said she was still on the issue of public participation and held that &ldquo;may&rdquo; should be used instead of &ldquo;must&rdquo;. It should still be inserted that the NLO &ldquo;may&rdquo; grant an application for any licences if he or she was satisfied that the two requirements had been met. If the applicant applied, it had to be published on the website and a time frame should be given, and input should be considered with the application. The reason for this was that if it went to appeal, it could drag the process out for a long time, but when the DAFF applied their minds they could also receive information from the public and everything could be done within the 45 days provided in section 3H(2). If people were not happy about something, they could bring it forward in the application phase so that it did not have to go to the appeal process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Filtane said that he had to depart early and asked whether he could raise his questions on clause 5 and receive the responses later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson responded that Mr Maxegwana could raise his issues on his behalf. She added that three Members were departing early, and one should not forget that a quorum was needed in order to discuss the Bill. The meeting might have to be adjourned if there was no quorum. She asked for advice from the legal team and the DAFF on the proposal made by Ms Steyn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Swartz said that there was nothing wrong with the proposal to put the application on the website before it had been processed, but it must hold that people could make submissions with their applications. There was nothing legally wrong with it, and was rather a policy decision that needed to be taken.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson said it was a responsibility and the implementers were executives. If it was put in legislation, it might not work. She thought the Committee had previously agreed to have it put in the regulations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn said that it had been discussed and agreed that the Committee would have a say in the regulations, because if it was left like that it would be up to the Minister and the DAFF to determine what was included in the regulations, which would be out of the Committee&rsquo;s hands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Ramokhoase said that it was an operational matter which depended on the Committee, and said some Members were concerned about the implementation by executives. However, he would have agreed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Phumelela Ngema, Parliamentary Legal Advisor, brought up two elements that needed to be noted on the issue. Firstly, with regard to the publication on the website, there was a question as to whether everyone was able to access the website. The second point was the making of an enabling provision with regard to the Executive making any publications, as in terms of the Prescription Act such publications must be published in the Government Gazette in order to have official status. This was an issue for consideration as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Songabe said that when this matter had been deliberated upon, it had first and foremost been indicated by the DAFF that in this Bill there was not enough room to formally compel persons other than the Executive in the issuing of licences. It had been great that the publication of any inputs made had been considered, but the DAFF was operationally concerned that it compelled that kind of participation. The DAFF had now reached consensus with what was provided in section 3C (1)(i) as it allowed the NLO to request input from any person and secondly, the provisions in section 3I(1), (2), (3) and (4) which allowed for further considerations of any concerns that may be necessary, which Ms Steyn had been worried about. Based on that, the DAFF was of the view that in addition, there were chapters on appeal, if anyone was of the opinion that the NLO had not applied its mind properly. If the publication and noticing of people were made compulsory, it would have additional administrative and cost implications, because it meant that all people would have to be able to access the website, newspapers and Government Gazette. Given the operational and practicality of this, it would be impossible. The DAFF believed all the concerns raised by Ms Steyn would be managed by 3C (1)(I), as well as the whole of section 3I. In the case of someone still being concerned that the NLO had not applied its mind, the DAFF was of the view that section 3M and subsequent sections allowed for it to be dealt with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson said that the explanation given by DAFF was fine, and Members agreed with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn raised a concern about the number of days, which had been reduced from 21 to seven in section 3J. She asked whether the Department could do it in the seven days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson said that they could, and that was why she had never raised it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn raised an issue in section 3K (3). She was happy if &ldquo;refused&rdquo; was left in there, but it was her suggestion that &ldquo;refused, suspended, cancelled or withdrawn&rdquo; be inserted, not only &ldquo;refused.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson said Members agreed that it would be inserted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn had an issue with the use of &ldquo;must&rdquo; and &lsquo;may&rdquo; in section 3O. She said that she knew it had been discussed but would like to know the reason why the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; refer it to the Appeal Board -- should it not rather be a &ldquo;must&rdquo; that the Minister refer it? She said that a timeframe should be put on this section, as the appeals may drag on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson responded that it was her understanding that when the matter had been dealt with, it was an executive function and legislation would give a mandate to the Minister, because the only person interacted with was the chief implementer, who was the Minister. If the Minister received an appeal, it had to be noted that the responsibility would have been delegated to the NLO. If the Minister felt on her own that she could not deal with the matter, she could establish an Appeal Board to deal with the matter. On the issue of &ldquo;may,&rdquo; if the issues raised were more complicated and needed legal minds or veterinarians, then an appeal board would need to be established for advisement. She asked if the Members agreed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Members agreed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn said she was back on to who could be a NLO. The Minister was not an expert, so if a matter went to appeal, would an expert be designated? She was asking questions so that the Committee did not later have to come back and say that this was an issue that should have been looked at. She asked whether a Minister could appeal licences issued by an expert.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson said that the Minister was given a mandate by the Public Service Act (PSA) to be the executing authority of the Department. The PSA did not say that for one to be a Minister, one was required to have the technical skills for the field in which they would be deployed, as it was the prerogative of the President. That was why the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; was used, because if it was something that the Minister could deal with without establishing an Appeal Board with expertise, he could do so. She then asked for the legal team&rsquo;s advice on the time frames.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Ngema said that in terms of time, it was an administrative function and since there was no provision that excluded the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act (PAJA), then PAJA would be applicable to the time frames given in the Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn asked if time frames should not be put in, and also asked what the time frames provided in the PAJA were.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Swartz said that PAJA was an overarching Act and provided set minimum timeframes, so in other legislation lower timeframes could not be given -- only more generous ones. If the legislation did not refer to timeframes, then the timeframes provided in PAJA became automatically applicable. Timeframes did not need to be included now, as the PAJA dealt with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn asked the legal team what the timeframes provided in PAJA were.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adv Van Aswegan said that she would look at PAJA and tell the Committee what the time frames were.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn said that she was still concerned with section 3M, and asked whether the general public could also appeal against a licence that had been awarded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Nagiah responded that any person in the general public may appeal. If one looked at section 3M it provided that &ldquo;a person&rdquo; may appeal and this referred to any person in the public domain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn asked how this worked in practice, and how the public would know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson responded that the regulations would be on the website, and the DAFF had said it would have a database where any person could obtain information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn said that the Committee needed to get the regulations so that it could deal with them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson responded that the DAFF did not have to bring them to the Committee in order for issues to be raised. Sometimes decisions should not be made that would undermine the Committee&rsquo;s authority, and the DAFF should deal with the matter even when it was not in front of the Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn said that the PAJA provided for the Department to be given 120 days. She asked what would happen if the matter was on appeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Swartz responded that the ordinary consequence when one lodged an appeal was that the order that was granted would be suspended till the appeal had been finalised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn said that was why she wanted the general public to have a say, before the issuing of licences. An example was, if a circus person made an application for a licence and someone appealed it, would his circus operations stop or how would it work in practice?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Swartz responded that not just any person could appeal, as that person must feel aggrieved and had to set out the grounds for the grievance before the appeal was qualified. Therefore there would be an initial inquiry to determine whether it was actually a valid appeal, and only if it was valid would it be processed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson said it was her understanding that if people just submitted appeals without them being qualified, Government would never operate. However if it was qualified by a person being aggrieved, it was justifiable to stop the activity of the person who was making an application for a licence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn asked what the legal basis for stopping someone&rsquo;s operations was, and whether it was general knowledge or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson said that it was not general knowledge, but when it was found that someone had contravened the legislation, then the activity could be stopped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Z Jongbloed (DA) said that it would be prudent to include timeframes. She had listened to all the scenarios where applications and renewals could be denied, but if a matter could take up to four months as prescribed in PAJA, if someone lodged an appeal then the person&rsquo;s business could be stopped for up to four months while the appeal was being processed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson responded that the issue of the time frame had been suspended, and the State Law Advisor would come back to the Committee with her findings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn said that this brought the Committee back to section 3K (3), which dealt with where the license could be suspended, withdrawn or amended, or that operations must stop. It made sense now. She was looking from all sides, which included the Department, the applicant and the appeal process. She also found an issue with section 3P, which was the consideration of the appeal by the Minister. Section 3P (1) said he may refuse or grant the application, then in section 3P (2) that he may give it to the Board on appeal, and then &ldquo;may&rdquo; refuse or grant the licence. This gave a lot of power to the Minister.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson agreed and said that the Department should be given an opportunity to respond on that. The Committee&rsquo;s view so far was that it had been discussed that the Minister had the powers and could deal with certain appeals in areas where he needed to, or if it was necessary to appoint a Board. This meant that experts would be brought in to deal with the issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Nagiah responded that her understanding was that the power would always be with the Minister, and when the Minister needed advice the Appeal Board would be constituted. What the Appeal Board was doing was merely making a recommendation to the Minister. The Minister could not divorce himself from making the final decision, and when the Board made a recommendation they may sometimes make an error. It just gave the Minister better information and comfort that the matter had been looked at properly, but the Minister must be afforded the opportunity to apply his mind and make a decision. There was also case law in that respect as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn asked whether the investigation in section 3O and the consideration in 3P was given a timeframe of 120 days. What did the law say on this issue?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Nagiah responded that the DAFF would have liked some time to look at it, but her understanding was that PAJA related to final decision-making and gave a timeframe for that in reference to the executive authority. Subject to correction, the 120 days referred to the final decision-making.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn said she had a concern with the regulations in clause five, which substituted section 7 of the Principal Act. She asked why the wording &ldquo;not inconsistent with&rdquo; was used, rather than &ldquo;in addition to 3F (2),&rdquo; which provided for what needed to be done. It had been previously been seen that where it was not inconsistent, the Minister had the power to change the regulations. She added that the &ldquo;devil was always in the regulations and not in the Act.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adv Van Aswegan responded that it must be remembered that the first three sections of section 7 were the same as those of the Principal Act. If it was said that &ldquo;make regulations that were not inconsistent with the Act,&rdquo; it was an empowering provision which had to be put into the Act so that the Minister could make the regulations. What was being said when &ldquo;not inconsistent with&rdquo; was used, was that the Minister must not make regulations that went wider than the scope of the Act. This in turn limited the Minister so that he could not include additional requirements that now needed to be met which had not initially appeared in the Act. The clause referred to all regulations made and could not be in contravention of any principles provided for in the Act. This was just standard wording for an authoriaation provision in Acts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson said that the essence of section 7 was that the Minister could not go beyond the ambit of the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn asked how section 7B (2) was to be understood. 7B (2) was related to the information to be supplied. She asked why it had been included, as it basically restrained the Minister.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson referred Ms Steyn to the section 7 amendment and section 7 in the Principal Act. She emphasised that the amendment of the Principal Act section 7 was what was being dealt with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn responded that she understood that there were some deletions, but she still did not understand why this applied to the &ldquo;information to be supplied&rdquo; if one could provide for &ldquo;other information&rdquo; in the regulations. For her, that was a contradiction because it said that the Minister could not give any other regulations that were not consistent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson said the Committee had requested the NA to look at section 7 and for them to identify issues which needed to be changed that were actually affected by the amendment. The issues that Ms Steyn was raising now were not affected by the amendment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Ngema said that as the preceding words in section 7 indicated, and the subsection 7B (2) which provided for &ldquo;information to be supplied,&rdquo; it enabled the Minister to get to the &ldquo;how&rdquo; part. It was something that could not be ignored or be changed. Further information may allow for the Minister to consider certain things that the Act could not go into because of the practicalities, and when the Minister knew what he was operationally dealing with he could identify and determine how it should be done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Swartz added that this regulation section did not give anything in addition to what was in the rest of the Act. For instance, the provision of section 3F, which provided for details to be given of where the animal would stay, section 7B(2) allowed for the Minister to go into the specifics which the NLO may need in order to make a well founded decision. This allowed for the Minister to put it into the regulations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson asked if Ms Steyn accepted the explanation. It was then passed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn had a concern with section 8, and said that subsection 2 and 3 should be deleted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adv Van Aswegan responded that section 8(1) and (2) had been bracketed, so it would be deleted before the enactment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn asked why there were all the references to the other sections in Principal Act. Why did one have to write the amendment of section 8 in the Amendment Bill?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson responded that she had earlier said that she had requested guidance from the NA on section 7,8 and 4 of the Principal Act because it still had wording of &ldquo;dogs&rdquo; that needed to be changed. Therefore unless one was saying that there was a problem with it, it was something that needed to be tabled and made open for discussion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn said she did not have a problem but was asking why the reference to &ldquo;dog&rdquo; could not now just be referred to as &ldquo;animal&rdquo; in the Amendment Bill. Why could it not just be bracketed or underlined as had previously been done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Swartz responded that it had been done that way because it was the drafting technique that had been used, and it had been meticulously looked at as to whether it would be better to do it this way. If the Member&rsquo;s suggestion was used, the Bill would be much longer and it would have more sections. The technique used was generally accepted and would sufficiently cover what the intention was behind it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn said that it would be confusing to the layman reading the Bill, but she was sure that it was acceptable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adv Van Aswegan said that she understood the concern raised by Ms Steyn, but after the incorporation of it into the Principal Act, it would be a much better read. It was only a drafting technique. It would have been more confusing to have put in the brackets and underlining in section 8, as the Principal Act was very inconsistent in its use and context of the word &ldquo;dog&rdquo;. That was why funny words had been used in section 8 so that it provides some context for the &ldquo;dogs&rdquo;. The Printers would incorporate it into the Principal Act as this was an instruction to them to change all those places and contexts where the word &ldquo;dogs&rdquo; appeared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn said that she understood and said that she had wrongly thought that it would be read in that way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson asked if there were any other considerations to be made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adv Van Aswegan said that on page 9, where section 7 amended section 11 of the Principal Act, the definition of an &ldquo;Animal Scientist&rdquo; had been changed and had been flagged for feedback from the DAFF as to whether it should include &ldquo;Certified Natural Scientist,&rdquo; or if it should be made &ldquo;Professional Natural Scientist&rdquo; only.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Songabe responded that the DAFF had looked at the three categories and appreciated the input from the Committee. The DAFF had come to the conclusion that the two categories of &ldquo;Certified Natural Scientist&rdquo; and &ldquo;Professional Natural Scientist&rdquo; were the most appropriate ones that could be used, because all had to have at least a three- or four-year degree or diploma, and would have been taught about animal welfare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Songabe added that he was excited about the aspect of licences, as all licences were due to expire on 31 December, so these measures would help the DAFF in dealing with those components until people applied for new licences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Swartz said that a decision should still be taken on the &ldquo;transitional arrangements&rdquo; which had been proposed, because they had to form part of the new Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Maxegwane, on behalf of Mr Filtane, asked about section 11B(1), and whether the licences could be endorsed. He said that in section 11B (3), the application needed to be prioritised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson said she agreed with section 11B (2),(3) and(4), as it was out of the control of the Committee when the meeting had been concluded, as the President would sign off on the legislation and it would become law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Ramasodi said that the DAFF was happy with the transitional arrangements clause. However, there was a standing issue to which the Chairperson had referred to in the introduction, in relation to the extension by the Constitutional Court. The DAFF needed to be guided as to what time extension should be requested, as this was pertinent to the &ldquo;transitional arrangements&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Swartz responded to the question on the endorsement of licences, saying it would now require an administrative process for a licence to be returned to the NLO to endorse it. The way it had been drafted now, it would not require the extra administrative burden of endorsing it by the NLO. This was how it has been endorsed, but it could be seen as an option. In response to the matter of prioritisation, that should be a question answered by the DAFF as to whether they could prioritise the applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn said that she was glad that the DAFF had mentioned the date on which the licences were to expire. She asked why section 11B (3) and (4) was needed, as the Act should become into operation before the expiry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Swartz responded that it definitely was necessary because one did not want work that had already been done to fall away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Ngema responded to the question by the DAFF on the time extension that should be requested. She said it would be difficult to decide on the time frame (extension), because it was not clear what programme or arrangements the NCOP would require to run with the process. However, she estimated a time frame of 12 months, as the previous extension asked for from the Court had been six months, and that was definitely not enough. There would definitely be an end result after 12 months and this would allow for the President to ensure that it became an enactment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson asked if all the questions had been answered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn asked whether all references in the Principal Act to &ldquo;penalty fee&rdquo; and the time frame period had been changed, as three areas had been noted in the Principal Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adv Van Aswegan said she had cast her eye on the Principal Act, and section 5 had not yet been dealt with. It could just be substituted and form part of what the Committee referred to the NA, as it was once again a consequential amendment. She thanked Ms Steyn for spotting it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson suspended the discussion, as a Member had to leave and this left the Committee with not enough Members to constitute a quorum. The minutes of the meeting held on 26 May also needed to be adopted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Songabe asked whether the PAPA should be taken away from the responsibility of magistrates and be dealt with as a Department. The challenge that the DAFF faced was that this work was so decentralised and scattered, and there was nowhere where it was being consolidated. After the DAFF started getting involved with it in late 2012, it had embarked on an effort to obtain all the information from the various magistrates and it had been found that given the nature of the records no clear information was available. One of the operational logistics that the DAFF had to consider was what the normal volumes were, and so forth. There had been a period of six months where there was a small committee commissioned by the North Gauteng High Court, where these applications had been dealt with centrally. Initially it was thought that this would provide a rough figure of the applications processed in the six months, because it was a centralised component. This was found not to be a good basis as an indication, as many people boycotted the committee because it was said to be unlawful. The final answer was that the DAFF simply did not know, as there was no yardstick as to the volume of licences. That was why the DAFF was waiting for the expiry of the licences in order to know the volume of licences, which would also be captured in the database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn said that this should be advertised beforehand so that one could get some kind of idea of volumes, as there were now deadlines and if one sat with 10 000 applications that had not been anticipated, then they would not meet the deadlines of seven and 45 days. This would result in many Court cases if this concern was not dealt with properly. Again, the &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;must&rdquo; issue came up. If one did not know how many applications were expected and had to be inspected, it needed to be stressed that the DAFF had to have a plan and strategy as to how it was going to be dealt with. This was why this amendment Bill needs to be looked at seriously, as the Principal Act was really not conducive to the protection of animals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Adoption of Minutes 26 May 2015</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The adoption of the minutes was moved by Mr Maxegwana and was seconded by Ms Jongbloed. The minutes were adopted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Modisane was then congratulated officially on behalf of the Committee for being elected President for the OIE, as he was raising the flag high for fellow South Africans. The legal team, which was comprised of the State Law Advisor, the DAFF&rsquo;s lawyer and the Parliamentary Legal Advisor, was thanked for its great work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The meeting was adjourned.</p>\r\n",

        "summary": "<p>The Committee continued its deliberations from Tuesday 5 June on the Performing Animals Protection Amendment Bill. It was told that in terms of the National Assembly rule 249, the Committee could go back to the National Assembly (NA) to request permission to look into the other provisions of the Principal Act, because the proposed Amendment Bill did not deal with certain sections of the Principal Act. These were sections 7, 8 and 4. A letter had been circulated that the NA, in terms of the rules of Parliament, allowed the Committee to look into those mentioned provisions not covered by the proposed amendment Bill. Before the actual deliberations on the PAPA Bill could commence, the Committee first had to deliberate on this additional requirement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The State Law Advisor summarised the incorporations that had been made since the previous deliberations, and Members raised a wide range of issues. These included the purpose of the Bill, the applications for licences, the use of &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;must&rdquo; relating to information required in applications, the reduced time frame for considering applications, the suspension and withdrawal of licences, the powers of the Minister, the appeal processes, the regulations, the definition of an &ldquo;animal scientist&rdquo;, and whether the DAFF should take over from the magistrates in dealing with applications. A major concern was to ensure that the Bill catered fully for the protection of animals used in exhibitions, such as circuses, or for security purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The minutes of the meeting of 26 May 2015 were adopted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Committee congratulated Dr Botlhe Modisane, Chief Director, Animal Production and Health: DAFF, on becoming the President of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), and said his election brought credit to South Africa.</p>\r\n",

        "body": "<p>Advocate Yolande van Aswegen, Chief State Law Adviser, said that the Performing Animals Protection Amendment Bill (PAPA) sought to amend sections 2 and 3 of the PAPA because these sections had been declared constitutionally invalid in so far as they related to magistrates deciding on and issuing licences to persons intending to train and exhibit animals, and to persons who used dogs for safeguarding.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Clauses 1 and 2: Repeal of sections 2 and 3 respectively</em><br />\r\nThese clauses dealt with magistrates issuing licenses for the exhibition and training of performing animals and for the use of dogs for safeguarding. The Constitutional Court declared these clauses as unconstitutional on the basis that a member of the Judiciary should not be performing administrative actions that were supposed to be performed by the Executive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Clause 3: Insertion of section 3A to 3L</em><br />\r\nThis clause sets out the procedure for the granting and issuing of licences, and matters connected with it. It ensured compliance with the Constitutional Court judgment. This clause further provides for the designation of a National Licensing Officer, the qualifications and functions of the National Licensing Officer, the appointment of experts to assist the National Licensing Officer, delegation of powers and functions by the National Licensing Officer, the procedure for the consideration and granting of applications for licensing, the duration of the licence, the process for the application of a licence, the hearing of applications if the National Licensing Officer can not make a determination on the documents provided, the process for the issuing of licences, the process for the withdrawal of licences and the validity of a licence anywhere within the Republic of South Africa.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSections 3A, 3B, 3C and 3D remained the same.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn section 3F (a), (b) and (c), &ldquo;an&rdquo; had been changed to &ldquo;any&rdquo;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConcerning &ldquo;Regulations&rdquo; under the Amendment of section 7 of Act 24 of 1995, the underlined sub-sections (dA to (dC) had been inserted to amend section 7.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nParagraph (e) dealt with the penalty of the fine, which had been increased from R4 000 to R20 000.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Clause 4: Amendment of section 11</em><br />\r\nThis clause sought to incorporate additional definitions into the Act that were consequential to the revised procedure adopted for the granting and issuing of licences. The following definitions had been inserted: &ldquo;Animal Scientist&rdquo;, &ldquo;officer&rdquo;, &ldquo;National Licensing Officer&rdquo;, &ldquo;head of department&rdquo;, &ldquo;use for safeguarding&rdquo; and &ldquo;Veterinarian&rdquo;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe heading had been amended to read as: Amendment of section 11 of Act 24 of 1935 as amended by section 7 of Act 7 of 1972 and section 9 of Act 7 of 1991.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSection 11 of the principal Act had been amended by inserting: &ldquo;(a) by the substitution for the definition of &lsquo;animal&rsquo; of the following definition:&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Clause 5: Insertion of section 11A</em><br />\r\nThis clause provided for an appeals process by the insertion of section 11A. Section 11A provided for the establishment of an <em>ad hoc</em> Appeal Board by the Minister, the appointment of members, the appointment of the chairperson, and the functions of the chairperson and Board.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSections 11B to 11E had been inserted in Act 24 of 1935.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n11B provided the &ldquo;Right to appeal&rdquo;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n11C dealt with the Appeal Board, composition and membership.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n11D provided for the investigation and consideration by the Board.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n11E dealt with the consideration of appeals by the Minister.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Clause 6: Short title and commencement</em><br />\r\nThis clause provided that the short title of this Act, when it is enacted, would be the Performing Animals Protection Amendment Act, 2015, which comes into operation on a date fixed by proclamation in the <em>Gazette.</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Discussion</strong><br />\r\nMs A Steyn (DA) raised a concern about the word &ldquo;animal scientist,&rdquo; because it could mean a person who was working in a lab or it could be interpreted differently.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Botlhe Modisane, Chief Director: Animal Protection, DAFF, explained that this was based on the issue of competence and qualifications in order to be called an animal scientist. The term referred to a natural scientist involved in the welfare of animals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs D Carter (COPE) wanted to know to whom &ldquo;officer&rdquo; referred in 3D.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Modisane said an officer could be a provincial or a national officer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn said there was no definition of the word &ldquo;expert&rdquo; in 3E(b).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdvocate Van Aswegen said the definition was in sub-section 3, which states that &ldquo;A person contemplated in subsection (1) must comply with the qualifications set out in section 3B.&rdquo; Another definition could be found in 3E(b), which states &ldquo;a person appointed in terms of section 3D.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn suggested that the publishing of the application, re-application and granting of licences should be included in the Bill so that people could make appeals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Carter said the issue should be mentioned in the regulations and be on the website of the Department, because media costs for publishing were very high.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr T Ramokhoase (ANC) supported Ms Carter, saying the Act encompassed regulations and no Minister could change that after it had been agreed to by the Committee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Parliamentary Legal Advisor responded that the National Licensing Officer would use his or her discretion to let the public know if there an application had been made, but that should be included in the Bill.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn stated that the appeal must be made before the licence was approved. The application of a licence must be published before it gets approved in order to allow time for an appeal and to shorten the process.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson reminded the Committee that it had deliberated on this matter before. The welfare of the animals could not be solved only through this Bill, because there were some people who used animals for rituals or cultural activities. This meant there was a need to consult many people about their culture. This issue of the animals&rsquo; welfare was going to delay the passing of the Bill, because it was a very long process.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn insisted that if the Department received an application, it had to publicise it on its website and indicate timeframes for the public to comment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson said the issue was whether this idea should go in the Bill, or in the regulations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Tembile Songabe, Director: Veterinary Public Health, DAFF, informed the Committee that there were provisions contained in the draft Bill published in April last year regarding the suggestion of Ms Steyn. The Department feared there would be never-ending objections. The issuing of licences was the determination of the executive, not on the approval or refusal from another person. This was a ruling that had been made by a judge in the Gauteng High Court.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Carter suggested that the Department should consider defining the word &ldquo;exhibit&rdquo; in 3F1(a).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdvocate Van Aswegen said that the definition was contained in the old Act and could not be introduced in the Bill. Once the Bill became the law, these provisions would be incorporated into the Act.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Carter said the definition was not sufficient, because the military used rats for safeguarding.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdvocate Van Aswegen said these were exceptions, and were covered in the old Act.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Ramokhoase explained this had been discussed before, hence the insertion of &ldquo;and others&rdquo; to cover animals like rats.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson reminded the Committee not to advance their personal issues, but to debate the inputs that had been received from the public.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn, concerning 3F sub-section 3, suggested that &ldquo;may&rdquo; be changed to &ldquo;must&rdquo;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdvocate Van Aswegen said that &ldquo;may&rdquo; had been inserted because the visit of the National Licensing Officer depended on the consent of the applicant.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Modisane elaborated that the insertion of &ldquo;must&rdquo; would take away the issue of consent. It also introduced a condition -- that before being granted a licence, the premises of the applicant should be inspected and this would delay the licensing process.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr L Ntshayisa (AIC) suggested the retention of &ldquo;may&rdquo;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Z Jongbloed (DA) proposed that the 21 days the National Licensing Officer should take to inform the applicant about the granting, refusal and amendment of a licence, should be reduced to 7.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Songabe explained that once the National Licensing Officer received an application, he or she would have to consider issues like research and consultation before granting or refusing a licence. This meant before talking to the applicant, the National Licensing Officer had to look at the implications of his or her decision. The 21 days was reserved for such considerations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe legal team of the Department said there was no reason why this could not be revised. It noted that the word &ldquo;within&rdquo; before &ldquo;21 days&rdquo; suggested that this could be done in three to seven days.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Carter, on 3J, wanted to know how many days it took to make a decision about the granting of a licence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Songabe said that in the regulations, it was proposed to be 30 days.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Carter suggested that the turnaround time be incorporated into the Bill.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson said that should be parked for the decision of the Committee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Jongbloed, on 3K, wanted to know what happened to the existing animals if the applications were not renewed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Songabe said this meant the National Licensing Officer had denied one the right to use them for performance, but one could keep them. He further mentioned there were certain reasons why a licence was not renewed. For example, it could be due to a disease. However, the Animal Protection Act would kick in and one would remain the owner of the animals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Carter, concerning &ldquo;Regulations&rdquo; under the Amendment of section 7 of Act 24 of 1995, enquired who decided on the application fees, because they had been increased from R50 to R350.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson informed the Members that the Committee had not yet received a presentation from the Department regarding &ldquo;Regulations&rdquo;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdvocate Van Aswegen told Members that some of the &ldquo;Regulations&rdquo; they had seen from the Department were invalid, which was why the legal team was still discussing them with the Department.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Modisane indicated that the Department would be guided by the Committee as to when it would like the Department to come make a presentation about the matter.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr C Maxegwana (ANC), regarding &ldquo;Penalty&rdquo; under the amendment of section 8 of Act 24 of 1998, suggested the deletion of &ldquo;he,&rdquo; which was a reference to the magistrate, as he reasoned that there were also female magistrates.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdvocate Van Aswegen agreed to the suggestion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn, on 11E, suggested the deletion of &ldquo;dog&rdquo;, and for it to be replaced by &ldquo;animal&rdquo;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Songabe indicated that in the final proof-reading of the document, it would be taken out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Jongbloed, concerning 11 under the insertion of sections 11B to 11E in Act 24 of 1935, wanted to find out why the road to appeal was so long, and why one could not rather go direct to the Appeal Board.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Songabe informed the Committee that the Minister designated a person. If that person failed, the Minister then had to approach the Board. The Board then advised the Minister on determinations. If the person went direct to the Board, the matter may end up in court, and the Minister could be sued.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn then asked if one could still go to court if one was not happy with the appeal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Parliamentary Legal Advisor said one had to exhaust internal processes first and then go to court if the matter could not be solved internally.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn wanted to know what the timeframes for an appeal were.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Songane said the proposed draft regulation stipulated 60 days.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Adoption of the Committee&rsquo;s Annual Performance Plan</strong><br />\r\nMs Steyn went through the document page by page.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson asked for a proposer for the adoption of the Plan.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Maxegwana moved for the adoption.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn seconded him.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Annual Performance Plan was adopted.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe meeting was adjourned.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "body": "<p><strong>Performing Animals Protection Amendment Bill: Parliamentary Legal Advisor&#39;s briefing</strong><br />\r\nMs Phumelele Ngema, Parliamentary Legal Advisor, said that when preparing this briefing she had looked at the Bill, the matters referred to the Committee and its response, and comments and Departmental responses on the public consultation process, submitted by the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF or the Department).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This Bill sought to amend the principal Act, The Protection of Animals Act No 24 of 1935. This Act stated that it would regulate &ldquo;the exhibition and training of performing animals&rdquo; and &ldquo;the use of dogs for safeguarding&rdquo;. Therefore there were two intentions behind the Principle Act. The first intention dealt with any kind of &quot;animal&quot;, requiring its handler to acquire a license in order for it to perform or to be trained to perform at an exhibition. The other intention for the Act was to regulate licenses for &quot;dogs&quot; (only) that were used to safeguard. So the definition of an &lsquo;animal&rsquo; read together with the exception in s 9 of the Act sought to address licensing of all performing animals, and dogs when they looked after people or property.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The regulation of any performing animal applied, with the exception of those mentioned in section 9, which specifically provided an exclusion despite the fact that the animals mentioned there performed or were used as dogs for safeguarding. The long title of the current Bill failed to make this distinction, and in fact took it away, creating a confusion, because it stated that the Bill was seeking to provide for .&quot;a procedure for the application for a licence to exhibit, train or use of an animal for safeguarding&rdquo;.&nbsp; Both purposes of the principal Act suffered a complete change by the current purpose stated by the Bill. It was therefore necessary to have a purpose clause. She explained that the long title of the principal Act would no longer apply once the new amendment Bill was enacted, for the long title of the Bill would state the new purpose, as the relevant sections of the the current Act would be replaced by the amendments. Therefore the choice of words and how they were phrased was crucial in order to eliminate confusion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe repeated that the DAFF had stated the proposed long title as &ldquo;to exhibit and train performing animals or use of dogs for safeguarding&rdquo;. She suggested that the &quot;use of dogs&quot; was not contentious on its own, but it took the Committee back to the concurrent functional area, under the exclusive local government matters found in Schedule 5 Part B, which referred to &ldquo;licensing of dogs&rdquo;. The fact that this was now listed in the Bill meant that the Bill was liable to be contested as to whether it had followed the appropriate constitutional procedure (being introduced as a section 75 or 76 Bill). Furthermore, Members of the Committee had raised a question as to how animals used for safeguarding, that were not dogs, would be treated and how the exclusions from licensing might apply. Examples were cited as horses used by provincial police departments, together with these departments&#39; dogs which were not covered under the section 9 exemptions. The Section 9 exclusion covered animals exhibited in the military or police tournaments or the safeguarding dogs, but not when they were working as safeguard &ldquo;animals&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She then said that the Parliamentary Legal team&rsquo;s suggestion was to provide a procedure for application for a licence to exhibit and train &ldquo;performing animals&rdquo; and &ldquo;animals used for safeguarding<strong>&rdquo;</strong>. The proposal was that the Bill should not mention &quot;dog&quot; as a separate class, but maintain the full definition of &quot;animal&quot;. That suggestion would make for better clarity, in general and for purposes of the section 9 exemptions, and for tagging purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She then looked at the definitions of &quot;exhibit&quot;, &quot;train&quot; and &quot;safeguard&quot; from the principal Act. Safeguarding,in terms of the principal Act related only to dogs. If DAFF intended to change that position, then there was a need to change the definition for &ldquo;use for safeguarding&rdquo;, in order to include the other animals such as horses, and remove &ldquo;of a dog&rdquo; and replace it with &ldquo;of an animal&rdquo;. If not, then the proposal from the Department was fine, if it intended to restrict safeguarding to dogs only, without the inclusion of other animals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bill set out that in regard to animal scientists, the The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA) must enforce the Act, ensure compliance for the purposes of the Act, and curb offences created by the Act in respect of protecting animals. However, she cautioned that the NSPCA cannot be a part of the licence-issuing process, despite the fact that was approved to do so in the interim agreement. She suggested that the proposal could only have an effect if proclaimed by the Minister to be the working process in case the Bill was not passed by 12 July 2015, and in case no extension had been requested to that date. However, that remained a Ministerial prerogative.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNeither the Animal Protection Act nor the Performing Animals Protection Act defined an &ldquo;animal scientist&rdquo;. The Natural Scientific Professions Act listed &ldquo;animal science&rdquo; as a field covered by that Act. The Collins English dictionary defined a scientist as a person who studies or practices any of the sciences or who uses scientific methods.&nbsp; DAFF had said, in its response to this query, that persons who had studied animal welfare were all included in the term &ldquo;animal science&quot;, without any specifications or restrictions, so the term was all-encompassing and relevant. She would suggest that it could be supported. In fact it opened up the scope wide enough without any discriminatory or unfair arbitrary exclusions or preferences towards any specific profession in animal welfare or animal sciences. Both &quot;animal scientist&quot; and &quot;veterinarian&quot; were extensive and broad without any unfair restrictions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Ngema moved on to explain the implementation of clause 3. The new section 3D&nbsp; empowered the Director-General, at the request of National Licensing Officer, to appoint public servants or experts,&nbsp; in terms of the Public Service Act, to implement the Act. In a way this clause does not depart from the actual mandate that it would be DAFF who had the obligation and power to implement this Act as the executive branch of national government. Indeed the expert would either be co-opted or appointed as a public servant, or in line with the laws regulating public service. The provision was legally sound, but she suggested, for greater clarity, that instead of using the phrase &ldquo;implement the Act&rdquo;, the Bill should actually qualify the task, and rather use &ldquo;to assist when necessary in the implementation of the Act&rdquo; .This proposal did not tamper with the constitutional and lawful mandate of DAFF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She noted that the new section 3D must be read with the new 3E, and that an &ldquo;Officer&rdquo; was defined to include employees from the provincial government or Department, and that &quot;other persons&quot; would refer to those appointed in terms of 3D and other provisions where they were mentioned. This was a clause that had a bearing on the issue of lawful delegation to provinces arise. Her suggestion was that the initial clause needed to be qualified with a requirement that consultation must take place with the relevant authority to whom the person granted a delegation reported or was accountable. The cross-reference to section 3B was also still acceptable and lawful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the new sections 3F and 3H, the DAFF proposals had only effected a change of &ldquo;this&rdquo; to &ldquo;the&rdquo;, and this had not made any substantive difference. However, the Bill would have to clarify which Act was being referred to; the content was speaking to both the the Performing Animals and the Animal Protection Acts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn relation to the proposals for the new section 3H, she noted that &ldquo;any animal&rdquo; should have been phrased as &ldquo;an animal&rdquo;, to bring it in line with the definition section in the principal Act. There was no need for a new definition in the Bill.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere were changes suggested to the new section 3H(3) and its use of &quot;may&quot;. However, she submitted that the use of &ldquo;may&rdquo; sought to cover both the discretion of the National Licensing Officer (NLO) and the permission or consent of the Applicant. She thought that &quot;must&quot; was not intended, for this would have denoted an obligation and taken away the discretion. The use of &quot;may&quot; meant that the NLO could, in his discretion, visit the premises, either with or without the permission of the applicant, as long as it was done according to the law - in other words, with a warrant or investigation note from a magistrate, or consent from the applicant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In relation to clause 5, she pointed out that the drafting standards would not permit the correction of the re-inserted 11A, as previously pointed out, and so a consequential correction would be necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries: Response to public inputs on the Bill</strong><br />\r\nThe Chairperson noted an apology from the Minister and the Director General of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, for their absence from the meeting. The Department had received public input and should present its response to the Committee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Bheki Cele, Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, explained that the Minister had to attend another important meeting.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr M Rahasobi, Acting Deputy Director General, DAFF, reminded the Committee that there had been discussions in May 2015 on the oral and written submissions in April. The Department has categorised the inputs into five areas, these being issues around general animal welfare, oral comments, and written comments, specific issues on clauses, and issues raised on the regulations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Tembile Songabe, Director: Veterinary Public Health, DAFF, said the presentation outlined the key issues. He explained some of the acronyms (see attached presentation) and gave a general background.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn relation to the general animal welfare, DAFF believed that even the principal Animal Protection Act was outdated, fragmented and difficult to manage in the current regulatory framework, and that it should be repealed when a modern and consolidated new Act repealed and replaced both it and the Performing Animals Protection Act. DAFF had already gone some way with a process to holistically address all issues pertaining to animal welfare, and believed that all issues raised under this category could be addressed in the draft South African Animal Welfare Strategic Framework, which would be published for public comments. In summary, he noted that the DAFF had at this stage not considered all animal welfare (AW) matters in the current Amendment Bill, but rather opted to these matters in the next phase of the DAFF regulatory review. The Department had had three options, which were:<br />\r\n1) to consider the technical amendments to the existing Performing Animals Protection Act (PAPA), focusing only on sections 2 and 3<br />\r\n2) to consider a total repeal of PAPA and its replacement with a new Animal Welfare Act<br />\r\n3) to consider a total repeal of Animal Protection Bill (APA) and PAPA, and consolidate them into one Animal Welfare Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inputs had been made on specific points and concerns on the purpose of the Bill. DAFF believed that in principle many valid points were made, and these would be incorporated into future legislation. However, in the context of its current approach, DAFF was only intending &ldquo;to insert certain provisions&rdquo;. It was not suggesting that the current Bill was designed to provide holistic protection on the welfare of performing animals and dogs used for safeguarding, nor that it was confined to only providing &ldquo;a procedure for the application for a license to exhibit, train or use an animal for safeguarding.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He reminded the Committee that the DAFF had proposed possible improvements and amendments to the PAPA of 1935, to repeal certain sections, to insert certain definitions; to provide for the designation of a National Licensing Officer, to provide for a procedure for the application for a licence to exhibit and train performing animals or use of dogs for safeguarding. It was also to provide for the functions of a National Licensing Officer; to provide for the issuance of licences; to provide for an appeals process; and to provide for matters connected therewith.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the specific oral comments and concerns on the purpose of the Bill, the DAFF was proposing that the revised purpose of the Bill could satisfy the inputs from the stakeholders, if these minor amendments could be factored into the Bill. The DAFF would be prepared accept any proposed alternative wording on the purpose of the Bill, as this was unlikely to impact on the content of the Bill or practical logistics around administration. In relation to clause 3B, relating to use of the term &quot;animal scientists&quot; , DAFF was of the view that the concerns over the use of &quot;animal scientists&quot; could be based on &ldquo;professional protectionism&rdquo;, which was in favour of the veterinary profession. &nbsp;DAFF was of the view that training of animal scientists was as inclusive in animal welfare matters as the training of veterinarians. If members of the veterinary profession were the only competent professionals to deal with matters of AW, then many members of the Animal Welfare Organisations would not be regarded as rendering AW work. DAFF held the view that &ldquo;ethical obligations&rdquo; of animal scientists towards animals were unquestionable. However, he pointed out that there is no specific training, course or module that leads to a qualification of &ldquo;Animal Welfare Professional&rdquo;, and that concepts of &quot;animal welfare&quot; are entrenched in all training, degrees and qualifications involving the handling of animals. He suggested that any objections to the use of the words &quot;animal scientist&quot; were not justified. Indeed, DAFF stressed that there could well be areas where animal scientists could be more knowledgeable, more experienced and better suited to pronounce on welfare of certain species that veterinarians. Therefore, DAFF proposed that the phrase &quot;animal scientists&quot; be retained, in relation to the issue of PAPA licences.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Songabe then discussed, in relation to section 3B, the inclusion of a reference to Animal Welfare Organisations (AWO) in issuing PAPA licences. DAFF believed that members described in section 3B had knowledge, expertise and/or experience in the field of animal welfare and animal rights. There was absolutely no evidence, justification or rationale for a contrary view. It did, however, view the proposal to include &quot;welfare animal rights activists&quot; in the issuing of licenses as &ldquo;unconstitutional&rdquo;. The Northern Gauteng High Court had specifically rejected the plea by the NSPCA to be involved in the issuing of PAPA licenses, when the matter was first brought before the court in 2012. The founding rationale was that this was a function of the Executive. The judgment specifically ruled that the NSPCA was not part of the Executive and therefore could not be party to the issuing of any licences. For that reason, DAFF advised against any attempt to include any AWOs in any compulsory formal issuing of PAPA licenses. Unfortunately, the submission by NSPCA appeared to propose similar inclusions of Animal Welfare Organisations in the process of issuing licenses, but again, DAFF advised against this. Furthermore, he pointed out that there were over 235 animal welfare organisations, and it would be hard to give a satisfactory justification for selecting one or two animal welfare groups to be part of the process. The issuing of PAPA licenses would be informed by scientific principles and sound animal welfare considerations. DAFF had consulted extensively with the Office of the Chief State Law Advisor (OCSLA) to come up with text that might satisfy AWOs of the possibility of giving them a role, and believed that possible consultation was the answer. This was provided for in the proposed new section 3C(1)(i) which said that the NLO &quot;may request, from any person or organisation, subject to the Promotion of Access to Information Act, 2000, (Act No. 2 of 2000) any information that may be required to enable the National Licensing Officer to consider an application for a licence.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpeaking to the insertion of a new section 3D, relating to the appointment of experts,&nbsp; DAFF wished to clarify that such experts would have to be, as set out in section 3B, an animal scientist or a veterinarian. They would become &ldquo;part of the executive&rdquo; once appointed in terms of the provisions of the proposed new section 3D. They would be acting in that capacity, not as representatives of AWOs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn relation to the proposed new section 3E(1), on delegation of powers and functions, the DAFF proposed that the Committee could reconsider the wording and factor in additional groups to those mentioned in section 3D. It was proposing to insert the phrase &quot;an officer&quot; in the new section 3E, and he pointed out that the proposed re-wording was initially captured in the Draft Amendment Bill that was published in April 2014. This would allow the delegation to other existing officers appointed in terms of the Public Service Act. He read out the revised proposal for the new section 3E(1), that the NLO may delegate any of his or her functions under this Act to: &ldquo;(a) An officer, and&rdquo; (b) An expert appointed in terms of section 3D&quot;. The section would then continue:<br />\r\n&quot; (2) A delegation in terms of subsection (1) must&mdash;(a) be in writing; and (b) state the nature and extent of the delegation.<br />\r\n(3) Person(s) contemplated in subsection (1) shall comply with provisions contemplated in section 3B&rdquo;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Songabe said that the wording of the new section 3F(1)(a) had been questioned since it made reference to the &lsquo;purpose of the Act&rsquo;, and stakeholders had said that the purpose was unclear. DAFF proposed, therefore, that the Committee consider re-wording this section to eliminate any ambiguity on the purpose, and this was consequential to the discussion on the purpose of the Bill, as discussed earlier. He suggested new wording that could refer to information furnished by the applicant, as contemplated by section 3H(2), that was:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&rdquo; in accordance with the purpose of the Act&rdquo;;<br />\r\n(2) the premises, accommodation, equipment and facilities that are utilised for the training, exhibition or performance of the animal are safe and will not cause harm to the animal&quot;. ~<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Songabe then moved on to clause 3H(1)(a) and (1)(b). DAFF proposed to re-word this section to remove&nbsp; &ldquo;any animal&rdquo;, and replace it with &quot;an animal&quot; he also proposed that a specific definition of &ldquo;an animal&rdquo; should be included in the current Amendment Bill, even if this may be perceived as &ldquo;superfluous&rdquo; as the definition was already in the APA. He read out the revised clauses.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn relation to clause 4, dealing with the revision of section 11(a), Dr Sonwabi noted that there was no specific term pertaining to &ldquo;animal scientist&rdquo; in the Natural Scientists Professions Act. However, the use of this term in the PAPA Bill was intended to specify natural scientists registered in the field of animal science, in terms of the Natural Scientists Professions Act. In view of the ambiguity, DAFF proposed that Members should amend the definition of &quot;animal scientist&quot; in this Bill, to provide more clarity and address the concerns. He suggested that this definition should be incorporated as follows: &#39;Animal Scientist&#39; means a person registered as a Natural Scientist in the field of &lsquo;Animal Science&rsquo; in terms of the Natural Scientist Professions Act, 2003 (Act No. 27 of 2003).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe reiterated DAFF&#39;s view that the definition of &quot;an animal&quot; was not affected by the Constitutional Court judgment and so DAFF was not proposing any amendments to this. He repeated that, for ease of reference, DAFF suggested that the definition could be added into the current Bill, but would remain entirely consistent with APA. He added that reptiles were excluded, as set out in section 9 of the PAPA, so that &quot;an animal&quot; would mean any equine, bovine, sheep, goat, pig, fowl, ostrich, dog, cat or other domestic animal or bird, or any wild animal or wild bird which is in captivity or under the control of any person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Songabe noted that comments and concerns had been raised on the regulations. One question asked how the Minister would designate the NLO, and DAFF responded that this would be in writing, published on the DAFF website.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother comment was that it was unclear whether the Draft Performing Animals Regulations would replace the current regulations, and DAFF responded that the repeal of sections 2 and 3 in the current Amendment Bill implied that the regulations issued in terms of these sections would also automatically be repealed, unless expressly specified otherwise. This would then mean that new regulations were needed, and draft regulations had been published on 2 April 2015.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother comment was that the Bill should set out the time allowed for the NLO to make a decision on an application. DAFF responded that this would be clearly defined in the regulations, as 30 days.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNSPCA had suggested that issuing of licenses should be centralised with the NLO, not delegated down. DAFF responded that the coordination for PAPA licenses would be done at DAFF, but that all the delegated officers would be able to issue licenses on behalf of the NLO in their respective provinces, and would send monthly reports to the NLO for monitoring and auditing purposes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother comment was that South African Police Service (SAPS) clearance should be a requirement in the processing of a license. DAFF responded that stakeholders had indicated that such a request to SAPS might take three months, delaying the issuing of the licence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother suggestion was that the licence should be valid only in the district where the application took place. DAFF responded that this was considered operationally impractical, as it meant that every time circuses, guard dogs or the film industry moved to another district, they would have to apply for a new licence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe SA Dog Academy had suggested that guard dogs should be exempted from the PAPA licensing requirements, as they were already regulated by the Private Security Industry Regulating Authority. DAFF noted that they were not excluded from the principal Act and there was no reason to do so now.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother submission suggested that all licences should be published in the Government Gazette, but DAFF pointed out the significant costs, up to R1000 for one page, and felt that the DAFF-maintained database was a better option, and it would periodically be issued for perusal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe final submission was that the movement permit of guard dogs was impractical, as thousands of security dogs were moved on a daily basis, and asked how this would be achieved without compromising the security of the public or public assets. DAFF responded that this was under consideration by the Technical Team. DAFF had conducted a workshop with stakeholders on 4 May 2015, focusing specifically on regulations, and this raised genuine logistical and operational concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Songabe concluded that the DAFF had considered all matters raised in the public submissions. Anything not covered specifically here was considered to be either generic in nature or the response was included in other responses. DAFF hopes that stakeholder concerns captured by DAFF are consistent with those captured by the Portfolio Committee and that responses provided by DAFF will assist the Portfolio Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Discussion</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson asked why a reference had been made to the Director General, rather than the Minister, in the new section 3D.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Deputy Director General explained that this would be retained as a reference to the Director General since that person retained administrative authority when it came to certain actions within the Bill, although the Minister retained executive authority.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs A Steyn (DA) strongly suggested, to the Deputy Minister, that the reason why this Committee was now tasked with trying to fix &quot;an unfixable Bill&quot; was that the comments of the DA, made right at the start, had not been taken seriously, and it necessary to take Committee comments seriously so that Parliament could positively affect the lives of the people. In the last meeting, at which the Deputy Minister was not present, the Committee made it clear to the Director General that it was not possible to hurry through this Bill. The deadline had already been k known to the DAFF for eighteen months, and the Constitutional Court case already postponed once. She was &quot;nicely cautioning&quot; the Deputy Minister to ensure that the executive did its work in a manner that would enable the Committee to do its work. All outstanding legislation must be brought forward to this Committee. She cited the example of the Red Meat Industry taking the Department to court because no inspections were taking place, and that had delayed the Committee working on this Bill, and put unnecessary time constraints on the Committee. Another Bill, relating to fisheries, at the end of the Fourth Parliament, had also not yet been brought to this Committee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn asked what had been changed in the draft Bill sent out for public comment in April 2014, either in principle or in fundamental wording, besides the paragraph and definitional changes. She asked if the DAFF had taken the submissions seriously or if it had merely been indulging in &quot;a tick-box exercise&quot; around the public participation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson interjected that Ms Steyn should be specific in her comments, so that the Department would be in a position to respond to specifics.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn responded that she could not ask specific questions on what stakeholders said to the DAFF, as the Committee was not a part of that process, but would like to know if any significant changes were made to the Bill after that process.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Deputy Minister said that he was trying to &quot;be as cool as possible&quot; but asked for the Chairperson to protect him from &quot;the howlers&quot;. He said that he had listened to Ms Steyn and requested that she now sit and listen to him. He had not been able to be present at the last meeting, but had apologised, explaining that since the Minister was travelling, the Deputy Minister had deputised for him. He was here today precisely because the DAFF took this Committee seriously. To be told that he does not take this Committee seriously made him really livid. Whilst he conceded that English was not his first language, being &quot;cautioned&quot; made him feel undermined and he stressed that &quot;you are not a Missus, and I am not a &#39;garden boy&#39; who would be cautioned&quot;. He demanded respect as much as he accorded respect to the Committee where due. He would try to be present at Committee meetings as far as possible, but Members must understand that there were other matters that took the executive members away, in which case he would apologise and send other officials to deputise at the Committee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nResponding to the question whether there had been significant changes between the first draft and this one, he noted that various paragraphs and pages have been completely taken out after the public consultation process and suggested that Ms Steyn had not done her job by comparing the original draft and the current version, which displayed her ignorance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson asked that the Members of the Committee use acceptable language. She told the Deputy Minister that she was sure that the Member did not intend to undermine him or the DAFF. She would like to apologise on behalf of the Member. She conceded that the word &quot;caution&quot; was indeed open to different interpretations, but the intention in using that was to try to hasten the work of the Department and thus of the Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn then asked if the provinces would play a role and what the impact would be of the Bill on the provinces, also whether this would affect the tagging of the Bill.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Rahasobi responded&nbsp; that the legal advisors of the Department and Parliament had tried to provide guidance on this matter when it was first raised. He noted that the main concern was whether the NLO &quot;may&quot; or &quot;must&quot; do things, but referred to the Parliamentary Legal Advisors&#39; earlier points, and believed that it would not be necessary to alter the current section 75 tagging, but this would be subject to confirmation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn asked how the licensing of animals in international circuses would be dealt with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Rahasobi responded that international circuses visiting South Africa would be subjected to the laws within South Africa, and basic international law would be applied in the local agricultural sphere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn asked when the Animal Welfare Bill would come before Parliament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Rahasobi referred to Ms Steyn&#39;s earlier comment, and said that the Department had also conceded that the Bill was &quot;unfixable&quot;. However, the Department was faced with having to make amendments in light of the Constitutional Court judgment. It had therefore looked to the relevant sections, 2 and 3, to try to amend those within the time frames. It was aware of the expectation by the Committee that the DAFF must then also come up with an Animal Welfare Bill that would encapsulate both PAPA and APA provisions. One of the presentation slides provided the key points. Everything would have to be evidence-based and respond to general animal welfare issues.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr T Ramakhoase (ANC) said that as far as the Constitutional Court judgment was concerned, he had noted great improvements towards finalising the Bill. The Committee was aware that the total revision would be a more lengthy process, as stakeholders would raise wider issues outside the narrow confines of the Constitutional Court matters, and he suggested that the Committee deal with those once the Constitutional Court responses were out of the way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Rahasobi responded that the Department was thankful for the guidance it had received in getting to its current position, and where it was headed, and he agreed that other issues would be dealt with in terms of a holistic new Act.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Rahasobi then said he would like to detail the points raised by Ms Steyn, and compare the April 2014 draft with the current Bill before the Committee today. After consultation with the stakeholders, all the proposed sections 3F, 3G, 3K and 3L were deleted. Definitions were also amended, following consultation. Various other sections deleted included wording around the Appeal board, the delegation of officers and the issues regarding National Executive Officers. In addition revised sections 11(a),(b),(c) up until 11(2) had been deleted.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe summarised that there were thus significant changes. During public input, the stakeholders had confirmed that all their inputs were taken into consideration, but there was a difference in the degree to which each one&#39;s submission resulted in changes. At some stage, DAFF had stressed that this was a question of autonomy and on the one side there were views of animal rights activists, and on the other the views of the users of animals. The Department had to be given space and provide clarity in policy, taking all of the science, administration and legal issues into perspective. The Bill as it stands was not weighted in favour of one side or the other. It looked at what would be legally feasible for the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson then asked why the revised section 3H referred to &quot;may&quot; and not &quot;must&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr C Maxegwana (ANC) asked for clarity on the reasoning behind option one in slide 13. He also asked for further elaboration on slide 34, in relation to section 3F(1) in the current version and the proposed versions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Songabe elaborated further on the three issues raised and on the operational and practical stances. Slide 13 accepted that there was a Constitutional Court judgment with which DAFF must comply; the point was merely now it would move forward. After discussion, it was decided that DAFF would, for the moment, concentrate on amending sections 2 and 3 that were specifically dealt with in that judgment.&nbsp; Further consequences would be handled elsewhere. This was option one in slide 13 of the presentation. Option 2 was to consider whether the DAFF could, now, take the opportunity to redo the entire principal PAPA, to look at the gaps within that principal Act, and come up with a new Animal Welfare Act to fix what that Act had been seeking to achieve. Principle Act was seeking to do. Option 3 was to work on the both the PAPA of 1935 and the Animal Protection Act of 1962, repeal both and reassemble them into one holistic Act that responded comprehensively on everything that deals with animal welfare.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, it was realised that between 11 July 2014 and January 2015 there was little time, and it was evident that it would take more time to identify and fill the gaps, based on new information. In some cases, the DAFF did not have welfare indicators. Mr M Filtane had raised a point previously that more research was needed on whether an animal was stressed beyond tolerance, so based on these factors, the Department considered whether option 2 might work, but again, bearing in mind that issues raised around sections 9 and 7 of the principal PAPA would also take more than the time available to fix. It was then decided that the DAFF would focus and opt for option 1, purely because of time considerations. Once the Department was done with the Constitutional Court issue, it would go back to the drawing board and pursue option 3.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe explained slide 34, and said that the main proposal set out there was that if the information furnished by the Applicant, as contemplated by section 3H(2), is in accordance with the Act, it would also be considered to be in accordance with the purpose of the Act. Both this morning and in previous meetings there were concerns that the purpose of the Act was not clear. For this reason, the Bill had deleted the phrase &quot;and is in accordance with the purpose of this Act&quot;. The purpose of the Act was a matter under discussion. The proposal was that the Bill shoulread merely &quot; the information furnished by the applicant as contemplated by section 3H(2).&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson noted the question raised by Ms A Steyn regarding the delegation to provinces. A suggestion had been made to in order to avoid making an unlawful delegation to provinces, that clause may need to be qualified with a requirement that consultation with the relevant authority to whom the person granted a delegation reports or is accountable must take place. He asked if the DAFF agreed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Songabe said that he would touch on the issue responded to by Mr Rahasobi in relation to the point about the appointment of the Director General in section 3D. The draft Bill of April 2014 had provided that those appointments would be done by the NLO. However, after an extensive consultation, it was decided that the powers must be given to the accounting officer of the Department, where the budgets were done. Now, the NLO would have to approach the Director General and say that he needed expertise in a certain area that could not be found within government. Because of the financial implications, the Director General, in consultation with the Chief Financial Officer, would assist the NLO with appointments, and these people would be appointed in the same way that all other public officials where the administrative function normally resided with the Director General.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson made the point, for clarity, that in terms of the Public Services Act, the only person who had power to employ was the executing Authority which could then delegate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Songabe said that this was something that could be considered and rectified if need be.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Songabe then responded to the question raised by Ms Steyn on the role of the provinces. At present, the work done by the Veterinary Services was such that there were norms and standards developed at national level. Some of the work in the field was directly done by the national officials, and some work was done by the provincial officials. Because of the urgency of the matter, it was indicated that use would be made of the field officials, who were provincial veterinarian officials, when considering those delegations. The DAFF presentation had proposed that the phrase &quot;an officer&quot; be added. Revised section 11(a) described that officer as a person appointed in terms of public health. DAFF took the view that the officer would be employed on national or provincial levels, as long as s/he was an officer employed in terms of the Public Services Act and complied with the provisions of section 3D of the Bill. In that way the provinces would be involved. This would be in place until the DAFF had managed to achieve what it hoped for, namely to have a whole Animal Welfare Team, but the cost of that had been mentioned to the Committee previously.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Songabe also amplified on the use of &quot;may&quot; as opposed to &quot;shall&quot;. If the Bill were to be worded that the delegation might be to a person who was not necessarily part of the executive, it would fall foul of the decision in the North Gauteng High Court, which stressed that since this was a function of the executive, the executive must fulfil that. &quot;May&quot; opened up an option, but the function would remain an executive one. If the Bill had used &quot;must&quot; it would formally bring people who were not members of the executive into the process of issuing the licenses, leading to the same situation where the licensing was deemed unconstitutional because it had been done by magistrates, rather than people forming part of the executive. He wanted to stress that this was a viable option, particularly for AWOs. If a licence had been issued and a body or individual was unhappy about that, it would be possible to appeal the decision.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe referred to the Chairperson&#39;s proposals on wording to be added, particularly in relation to consultation prior to delegation to provinces, and said this seemed acceptable. The DAFF did actually already work &quot;in consultation&quot;. The development of this Bill and subsequent regulations, as well as work on the Draft Animal Welfare Strategic Framework had been done by a team of officials from DAFF and all the nine provinces, so the provinces were already involved and their role could be further enhanced by this proposal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Deputy Minister agreed that the proposal seemed acceptable, but would be subject to further consultations and discussions between DAFF and the Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson reminded the Deputy Minister that the Bill was in front of the Committee right now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn referred to slide 34 and said the deleting of sections would not fix the Bill. She still believed that the purpose of the Act must be changed, but it must first be established with certainty. ill not fix the Bill and suggested that the purpose of the Act should be changed to something else. Actually, the purpose of the Bill was to bring the legislation in line with the Constitutional Court judgment but one should not make laws like that. She did not want to fight with the Deputy Minister, which was why she raised the points she had. She did not expect him to be at every meeting; everyone here was capable of working on their own, but issues like this did make her upset.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson abruptly stopped Ms Steyn and said that this matter had been closed earlier and she would not allow it to be re-opened and disrupt the meeting.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn apologised. She said that if the Committee could not agreed on the purpose of the Bill then it could not be fixed by deleting that section; the purpose would have to be changed, or some other solution found from the proposals, but the Committee and Department could not move forward if they could not agree. She had looked at the 2014 Draft Bill and knew that certain sections were deleted, but the purpose or the implementation had stayed exactly the same. She asked about the removal of the renewal of licenses in the Bill, and how this would be done now.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr T Ramakhoase thought that the issue of Local Government had been clarified, and should not arise when dealing with the issue of Provinces and the spheres of government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms A Steyn then asked how far the Animal Welfare Bill had gone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson said that the issue of the Animal Welfare Bill should not be brought up in this meeting. The Committee must deal with issues of concurrency. She suggested that within the next six months the Committee must get a report and feedback on how far the DAFF had gone, because the Animal Welfare Bill needed to be understood by everyone in the same way. Cultural and traditional aspects had to be dealt with to reach a common baseline understanding, to gain consensus and to avoid unnecessary fighting. Within those six months, the Department should start that process by engaging with communities to establish a baseline and deal with the legislation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Songabe said that the purpose of the Bill had been deliberated by the DAFF, but it would be prepared to consider other suggestions. The amendments dealt with sections 2 and 3, and there would not necessarily be practical operational or administrative effects. The Department remained open to suggestions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn relation to licences, he explained that the license would remain valid for a period of 12 months. Once that period lapsed, that license would cease to exist. The regulations did say that prior to the expiry, an applicant may apply for a new license, valid from the date of expiry. This was because it had, during the discussions, become clear that there was an expectation that because of the inspection and requirements complied with in the first instance, this meant that the renewal would be automatic, without further inspections taking place. People did not expect to approach the NLO in advance, and would carry on under an expired license. It was stressed that the the validity was one year, with renewal applications having to be made in advance, and all the compliance and inspection procedures being the same for every renewal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson agreed that the Department had attempted to define the purpose, as set out on slide 16. However, the problem was that the Bill had referred to &quot;dogs&quot; for safeguarding and stakeholders had raised the point that there were also other animals used for this purpose. She asked how the Department intended to define this.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Songabe responded that there were two aspects. Firstly, the PAPA referred to dogs for safeguarding. Secondly, section 9 contained exemptions for dogs such as military and police dogs doing safeguarding work. The Department had yet to come up with a creative way to reconcile one section that applied to dogs and one that excluded certain groups of animals. The Department would be dealing with that as it moved forward. Stakeholders had suggested that an AW matter remained precisely that, no matter whether the dog was used for police or any other type of work, and that no exclusions should apply. The Department had agreed to consider that. At the moment, though, the animals were exempted, and that section had not been challenged. The Department would deal with the definition of animals for safeguarding and the exclusions in the holistic review.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson said that the Parliamentary legal advisors had suggested that the word &lsquo;dogs&rsquo; should be removed and the word &lsquo;animals&rsquo; be inserted, to cover all animals that are used for safeguarding in the long title.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Songabe responded that that was a very good suggestion and will be considered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Ramakhoase asked if the local government authority provisions were repealed, so as not to cause problems at a later stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Songabe responded that this was not really discussed. The Department&#39;s focus was primarily on sections 2 and 3, which had been specifically cited in the Constitutional Court judgement, whilst issues not mentioned there were not being considered at the moment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs P Ngema clarified and said that the point basically came about on the basis of the Schedule, and how the legal team had been instructed to tag. The current order had been explained. However, it was necessary now to decide which sphere was regulating what matters. Those in Schedule 5 Part A were matters dealt with by provinces. Schedule 5 Part B set out those reserved for local government, unless there was a matter being dealt with before Parliament under section 44(2). She thought that the issue only arose on that point, not the broader spheres.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson noted that no deliberations would take place on the Bill today, as Members were preparing for the Presidential Budget vote.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Other Committee business<br />\r\nAdoption of minutes</strong><br />\r\nMinutes of the meeting on 14 April 2015 were adopted.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMinutes of the meeting on 28 April 2015 were also adopted. Ms Steyn made the point that the bullet point on page 6 relating to the workshops that the DAFF held on the Bills had to be considered.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson responded that this would be considered on 9 June. She suggested that the Committee must look at extracting points from the minutes, so that they did not drop off the table.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMinutes of the meeting on 8 May, 12 May and 15 May 2015 were adopted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Invitations to nominate candidates for Land Bank Board </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson said that the letter received from the Minister of Finance said that there were three vacancies on the Land Bank Board. However, this letter was signed on 1 March, and the nomination should have been made by 20 April. She was following up on whether nominations were still required, to prevent Members forwarding C Vs unnecessarily.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr P Mabe (ANC) suggested that before members engage in a laborious exercise of tabling CVs ,the Committee must establish if they would be accepted.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson agreed, but thought that the CVs should be forwarded to the Committee Secretary in the meantime, in case an extension had been allowed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Invitation to the Committee to attend the South African Poultry Association (SAPA) AVI Africa 2015 Conference</strong><br />\r\nThe Chairperson noted that an invitation was extended to Members to attend the SAPA AVI Africa 2015 Conference. Not everyone would be expected to attend, but the Committee would delegate two or three to attend, after having received expressions of interest from Members. Anyone attending would be expected to give good feedback to the Committee. There was nothing on the Committee schedule for that week, although this must still be confirmed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe meeting was then adjourned.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "summary": "<p>The Parliamentary Legal Advisor briefed the Committee on the amendments being proposed by way of the Performing Animals Protection Amendment Bill, amending the principal Act (PAPA), since sections 2 and 3 had been declared unconstitutional and Parliament had been required to pass amending legislation. The Legal Parliamentary Legal Advisors suggested that a purpose clause was needed, in view of apparent conflict between the long title of the principal Act and that of the Bill; the Act had referred to the training of animals, and to the use of &quot;dogs&quot; for safeguarding. Certain dogs were excluded from the requirement for licensing, such as those used in police or security work. It had been noted that the licencing of dogs under this Bill might conflict with the licensing of dogs function that resided in local government, and Members had asked how the Bill was to treat other animals used for safeguarding apart from dogs. It was suggested that there not be separate mention of dogs but the full definition of animal be maintained. It would be necessary for the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) to clarify its intention on use of animals in general for safeguarding. It was clarified that the NSPCA, although involved in the licensing process at one point, could not continue to be, as this had been specified as an executive function. It was noted that although the term &ldquo;animal scientist&rdquo; was not defined, it was probably wide enough. The appointment of public servants or experts to assist in the licensing process should be amplified. The Natural Scientific Professions Act listed &ldquo;animal science&rdquo; as a field covered by that Act. The Collins English dictionary defined a scientist as a person who studies or practices any of the sciences or who uses scientific methods.&nbsp; DAFF had said, in its response to this query, that persons who had studied animal welfare were all included in the term &ldquo;animal science&quot;, without any specifications or restrictions, so the term was all-encompassing and relevant. She would suggest that it could be supported. In fact it opened up the scope wide enough without any discriminatory or unfair arbitrary exclusions or preferences towards any specific profession in animal welfare or animal sciences. Both &quot;animal scientist&quot; and &quot;veterinarian&quot; were extensive and broad without any unfair restrictions.&quot; The advisors commented on the implementation of the new sections 3D to 3H and suggested changes for greater clarity. They amplified that the word &quot;may&quot; under the proposed new section 3H(3) was deliberate to allow for discretion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe DAFF then gave a detailed explanation of its responses to the points raised in the public submissions process, noting that there were quite a number of changes between the original draft of the Bill and the version before the Committee now. Comments were categorised into five broad areas. It was explained that although the DAFF believed that a holistic change to animal welfare was needed it had, considering the short time frames available for the changes demanded by the Constitutional Court ruling, decided to focus on that first and then embark on a complete repeal and replacement of the PAPA and the Animal Protection Act (APA) by one consolidate Animal Welfare Act. Meantime the current concerns raised by the Parliamentary Legal Advisors and other comments were outlined. The comments detailed the Department&#39;s viewpoints on the reference to animal scientists, the inclusion of references to Animal Welfare Organisations in issuing of licences, and why this could not be done, but did say that it would be willing to consider a consultation process. It was prepared to consider other wording around the purpose. It was suggested that the definition of animal scientist be amended in this Bill, &nbsp;&nbsp;definition of &quot;animal scientist&quot; in this Bill, to provide more clarity and address the concerns, and that the definition of an animal, although not necessary, should also be included in the Bill for greater clarity. It was also confirmed that the NLO would be designated in writing, and the names published on the DAFF website, 30 days was the time for making a decision on applications, that new draft regulations were being discussed as the old ones under sections 2 and 3 would be repealed, that coordination would take place centrally for the licensing process but the actual licenses issued in the provinces. It was considered impractical to insist upon police clearances, and to allow licenses to be valid only in the district where issued. Requests for exemption of guard dogs were not supported, as they were not presently exempt. However, the movement permit for guard dogs was being discussed, as significant logistical difficulties had been cited.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA DA Member and the Deputy Minister exchanged heated words about the progress of this Bill and the replacement legislation, with the DA saying that had the Committee&#39;s concerns being considered properly at the outset, this situation would not have arisen. The Deputy Minister assured the Committee of his and the Department&#39;s full respect for the Committee and did not take kindly to being &quot;cautioned&quot; to do its work in a certain way by the Member. Members asked what exactly had changed in the versions, whether provincial involvement would affect the tagging of the Bill, how international circuses would apply, and when the Animal Welfare Bill was likely to be brought to Parliament. They debated the &quot;may&quot; and &quot;must&quot; provisions and the options open to the Department for amendments, and how in practice the licensing and delegation would work. Further discussions took place on the purpose of the Bill. Members asked about the validity periods and how &quot;dogs&quot; would be defined in the future Bill.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Committee adopted minutes of meetings on 14 and 28 April and 8, 12, and 15 May. They noted a request to nominate candidates to the Land Bank Board and would find out if the closing date had been extended, and an invitation to Members to attend the South African Poultry Association Conference.</p>\r\n",

        "body": "<p><strong>Plant Breeders Rights Bill and Plant Improvement Bill: Public hearings<br />\r\n<em>African Centre for Biosafety submission</em></strong><br />\r\nMs Haidee Swanby, Representative, African Centre for Biodiversity, an NGO based in Johannesburg, stated that hunger affected 64% of South African children, as reported in the news on the previous day.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe would firstly comment on the Plant Breeders Rights Bill. She noted that the South African seed sector was at a total value of R5.5 billion (maize contributing R3.4 billion) in the market. South African commercial seeds markets are presently concentrated among a few major corporations, resulting in a lack of competition and thus a rise in seed prices. Grain producers are increasingly concerned about the seed prices. She commented that any new legislation should accommodate the interest of all stakeholders, and seeds must be innovated for this reason. A fair and equitable system of plant variety should be protected, to encourage local breeding and stimulate innovation in the sector, to support the development of farming systems and strengthen capacity of farmers to develop varieties adapted to social and ecological conditions. The World Trade Organisation had suggested that the State should grant exclusive rights to plant producers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Small producers were equipped to stay with the provisions of the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) Convention of 1991, to which South Africa was not actually a party to. It was however a party to the 1978 convention which recognises and ensures to the breeder of a new plant a variety rights that should be respected, however the current new system, which requires much more from the producers, such as recycling and exchange is a challenge. Breeders&#39; rights are challenged by the contemplation of having to pay royalties. In conclusion, the major issue is that the current agriculture system is failing South Africans, the must be incentive in seed breeding and to ensure protective laws on the sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turning to the Plant Improvement Bill, she noted that the main issue here was that the innovation happened for one sector, Distinct Uniform Stable, where plants can be planted together, to nourish each other in the soil. The one-seed system is affecting farmers and the support they get from government, and the &quot;dumping&quot; of seeds and chemicals on farmers is not good.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe noted that a current problem was the undermining of agro-ecological farming, assuming that farmers wanted to be in mainstream farming, but that was not true. The legality of sharing seeds must be equitable across the country. There should be more public breeding with the farmers, consultations must take place, and support was needed for organisations, to develop new mechanisms. There must be a safeguard clause. This Bill also appeared to be geared to commercial farmers and was not helping the small farmers on the ground.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson referred back to the issue of the statistic of 64% of South African children being hungry, and said that this may not be true, given the interventions of the School Nutrition Programme, and social security grants available to many South Africans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Biowatch submission</em></strong><br />\r\nA representative for Biowatch explained that this was an NGO based in KwaZulu Natal and the farmers who belonged to it would be making presentations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Ntombi Ndandwe, Mr Thembinkosi Mthembu and Ms Samu Zuma spoke about their farming experience and the implication of the Bill on their work.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Ndandwe mentioned that traditional seeds were part of her culture, and were planted annually with other seeds so that they could increase. She noted that this provided for healthy foods, saved water, that farmers did not have to keep re-buying seed and that they would not need to buy chemicals. She suggested that it would be instructive for the government to come and visit sites to see what was done in organic planting, and commented that farmers needed the support of government to provide farmers with machines for grinding maize. The problem was that people were now having to go to the shops and buy mealies that were not organic. She said that future generations should still be able to see and use organic seeds.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Mthembu stated that organic planting and production kept the soil fertile, and the issue of production was also worth mentioning because of products that were not given space in the very competitive market. Organic farmers who were proud of their organic traditions wanted the chance to expose their produce to the market. It was expensive to buy manure all the time, so the traditional methods were sufficient. He claimed that the Bill would lead to &quot;starvation and poverty&quot; and pleaded that traditional farming should never be taken for granted.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Zuma indicated that she worked with farmers in understanding their indigenous farming traditions, and they had a method of sharing seeds, instead of buying them from commercial stocks. The government should support these farmers by providing them with seeds, so they could be able to produce more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Elfrieda Pschorn-Strauss, Biowatch representative, said that South African policies and laws should protect the cultural biodiversity in South Africa, equally with the commercial interests of the country. The current law did not specify how implementation of many of the provisions would work; and it also alluded to criminalisation of farmers. She noted that any legislation must be specific. Farmers must have incentives to breed, and share their seeds. The legislative framework must be inclusive of the traditional sector.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe noted that the Department must be commended for engaging with the public on this matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Discussion</em></strong><br />\r\nMr C Maxegwana (ANC) asked for clarity on the request by ACB for access to machinery, and wondered if use of machines for grinding would in any way affect the nutritional value of the mealies produced.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr T Ramokhoase ANC suggested that the farmers should check whether they were not already able to link in to farming programmes of government that assisted farmers with equipment to accelerate their production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Z Jongbloed (DA) asked for clarity on the issue of seed dumping by the farmers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson mentioned that both NGOs had expressed the fear of exclusion of small holder farmers, but she wanted to note that the Bill did take into account the interests of all farmers. The Bill was still to go to the National Council of Provinces and the National Assembly for further deliberation, so this was not the conclusion of these matters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Biowatch representative said that farmers were benefiting from the government to some extent, but it was not sufficient. There needed to be far more done; for example, skills development should be aligned to agriculture. It was not the responsibility of the farmers to inform the public on agricultural awareness; the government must recognise traditional farming and support it wherever possible. The most nutritious foods were those derived from natural seed and farmed without chemicals and these did taste different. Some time ago, machinery had been made available but it was not any longer. It was important for the farmers to be able to make their own preparations such as planting, and there were agreements for tapping into the market- such as with Pick n Pay, who did support the farmers. The supermarkets had commented that spinach produced organically stayed fresh for far longer; there was no secret, it was simply by using traditional farming methods.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><em>Agricultural Research Council (ARC) submission</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prof Bongani Ndima, Stellenbosch-based representative, Agricultural Research Council, noted that the Council (ARC) was a statutory body, established under Section 2 of the Agricultural Research Act, 86 of 1990. The ARC had a direct interest in the provisions of the Plant Breeder&rsquo;s Rights Bill, 2015.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome of the recommendations on this Bill were set out. Firstly, in relation to the definitions, the ARC recommended that the word &quot;person&quot; in the definitions should be expressed in the plural, to be inclusive, or even an adjustment to person(s) would be sufficient.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt was further proposed that the subsections should specifically read that genetic modification was essentially a derived variety.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSection 32(b) of the Act should be-read with section 6(2) instead of section (7).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn terms of penalties, the ARC recommended that the fines should be four times the normal fee, to be a stronger deterrent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally, he summarised that the ARC was important for the transparency of the agricultural sector,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>TopFruit submission</em></strong><br />\r\nMr Peter Allderman, TopFruit representative, said that the legislation must follow the rule of law and be objective rather than merely reasonable. He introduced TopFruit by saying that it was a business that had been in existence since 1983 and specialised in the commercialisation of fruits in South Africa. The business had planted at least 15 million trees, creating 20 000 jobs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe commented that the phrase and definition of &quot;essentially derived varieties&quot; gave rise to differences in interpretation. For the clause dealing with the farmer&rsquo;s privileges, he suggested that this should not&nbsp; include flowers and fruits, and they must be excluded from the clause. He suggested that successful marketing programmes should receive annual reductions on marketing fees.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe noted that the draft produced for workshopping was not in line with the current draft. Some clauses had been adjusted without consultation after the workshop, when he believed that these clauses had been agreed upon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) convention of 1978 provides that plant breeders rights are time-bound intellectual property rights, meaning the protection of these rights can expire over time &ndash; given the legislation of each specific country, the minimum is 15 years, however the recent UPOV -1991 extends this time period to 15-20 years as minimum time. It is imperative for the Bill to refer to these provisions of the UPOV, so that they can be sound an in sync. Our laws must be in line with rectified conventions such as this one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, he commented that guidelines must be provided for compulsory licensing dealt with elsewhere in the Bill.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><em>South African National Seed Organisation (SANCOR) submission</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The representative for the SANCOR noted that this organisation was established in 1989 and had 114 members, with interest in the seeding industry. Food security remained a serious matter throughout the world, and South Africa must align its legislation in context with the lives of its people, and the realities of poverty and inequality.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSouth Africa must be covered by the UPOV, the organisation formed in compliance with the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants, and it was suggested that it would be important to rectify this Act, as it would help advance the agricultural sector to meet global markets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe South African National Seed Organisation supported the Plant Breeders Rights Bill as it presently stood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it did wish to comment on the Plant Improvement Bill, and highlighted the need to efficiently use scarce resources. International trade was an important source of income, and this demanded good use of internationally accepted methods and procedures. The South African National Seed Organisation also broadly supported the Plant Improvement Bill.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><em>Discussion</em></strong><br />\r\nMs Jongbloed asked if Prof Ndima could explain the budget cut and the reasoning for that. She asked why it was felt that the implications to intellectual property were so severe, and asked if there were other options. She asked how the ARC would try to ensure that information was being transferred to small holder farmers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Ramokhoase asked TopFruit about the 20 000 jobs created, and whether those had been created in farming, or the actual production process? He also asked for more comment on why the 1978 Agriculture Act was favoured and asked for justification on that issue?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson asked the South African National Seed Organisation about the fact that it had cited comparisons with the United States of America, and said that this was worrying because USA was surely not producing seeds tolerant to drought that would be needed in Africa, and asked if this had been tested, and where the observations were derived.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Jongbloed asked presenters to comment on the red tape that seemed to be inherent in the Bills, for the Bills seemed to be putting a lot of power in the hands of the Department of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries, and the Minister.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SANCOR responded that there had been evidence from Kenya in relation to the drought resistant seeds imported from the USA, and such research was conducted by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It further commented that the Plant Improvement Bill was voluntary, on the basis that sellers had discretion on what to sell and to whom, and this was good for the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prof Ndima from ARC responded that he believed that a term of up to 10 years of imprisonment was a reasonable penalty for anyone found guilty of breaching this legislation. Budget cuts had been effected and the implication was that some researchers had to be retrenched, given the financial implications of the National Treasury directive that only critical vacancies should be filled. He commented that the development and research in both science and technology fields were vital for economic development in the country. For South Africa to come up with good responses to international advancements, it would need skilled scientists housed in several research institutions right across the country. Poor farmers should be supported with all means possible and a failure to do so could not be excused. The concentration of power was not well defined in the Bill, thus he believed that it would not be dealt with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Peter Allderman said that TopFruit had supported the 1991 At although he commented that it was unfortunate that South Africa had not rectified this Act, as those countries with better food security had addressed similar issues and rectified inconsistencies. He believed that compliance with the requirements of the Act would be beneficial to the agricultural sector entirely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson noted that some Mitchells Plain farmers were present, but since they had not asked for a presentation slot in advance of today&#39;s meeting, their presentation should be presented in writing to the Office of the Chairperson.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe meeting was adjourned.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "summary": "<p>Public hearings were conducted on the on the Plant Breeder&rsquo;s Rights and Plant Improvement Bills. The&nbsp; African Centre for Biosafety noted, speaking firstly to the Plant Breeders Rights Bill, that the South African seed sector was worth R5.5 billion (maize contributing R3.4 billion) in the market. South African commercial seeds markets were presently concentrated among a few major corporations, resulting in a lack of competition and thus a rise in seed prices, which were becoming of increasing concern also to grain producers. The Centre stressed that any new legislation should accommodate the interest of all stakeholders, and seeds must be innovated for this reason. Fair and equitable systems of plant variety should be protected, to encourage local breeding, innovation, support local farming systems and encourage farmers to develop new varieties best suited to social and ecological conditions. Breeders rights were being challenged by the contemplation of royalties and the new system would prove too onerous and not give enough incentives. The main issue with the Plant Improvement Bill was that the innovation happened for one sector, but the one-seed system was negatively affecting farmers. There was an assumption that all farmers wanted to follow the mainstream route, which was not correct, and sharing of seeds should be equitable and legalised. More public breeding should be encouraged, farmers must be consulted and support was needed to help organisations develop.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBiowatch, an NGO based in KwaZulu Natal, gave the views of three farmers farming using organic and traditional methods of farming, all of whom stressed that the way that farmers planted to increase their stock of seeds (which were also exchanged) produced more resistant and healthy plants and did not use chemicals. Farmers required support from government for heavy equipment such as grinders for maize, but there should be recognition of the value of organic methods. Products were not being given sufficient space in the commercial markets, and traditional farming should not be taken for granted. Biowatch urged that South African policies and laws should protect cultural biodiversity in the nation. The current Bills were not specific enough on implementation and alluded to criminalisation of farmers, which was of concern.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAgricultural Research Council (ARC) made recommendations for the amendment of definitions, and a more specific statement in the Bill that genetic modification was essentially a derived variety. It was in support of stronger penalties.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTopFruit also commented on interpretation and suggested that a definition of &quot;essentially derived varieties&quot; was open to interpretation. It was suggested that farmers privileges should not include flowers and fruit, which should be excluded from the clause. It was suggested that successful marketing programmes should receive annual reductions on marketing fees. One concern was that the draft produced in the workshops, on which agreement had been reached, was not the same as the current draft. Guidelines would be needed on compulsory licensing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe SA National Seed Organisation agreed that food security was a serious matter throughout the world, not just in South Africa. Any legislation must be fully aligned with the realities of poverty and inequality. It was also important to align anything with the principles of the UPOV Convention. It would be important to&nbsp; to use scarce resources efficiently, also in order to boost international trade. The principles behind the Bills were broadly supported.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMembers asked for more clarity on the request for access to machinery, and suggested that farmers should check whether they were not already able to link to other farming programmes and incentives. More information was requested on reports of seed dumping. Members assured the audience that the Bill did take into account the interests of all farmers. They asked for explanation of the budget cuts of the ARC, and asked for more elaboration on why it was felt that the Bills challenged intellectual property rights. TopFruit was asked to expand on the creation of jobs. SANCO was asked why it had cited USA comparisons and how these were relevant to Africa. Members also asked presenters to expand on whether they felt the Bills were creating too much red tape or putting too much power in the hands of the Minister.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

If the Committee agrees with the principle of the draft Bill, a Bill will be prepared and dealt with by Parliament.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe National Council of Provinces Select Committee on Members&#39; and Provincial Legislative Proposals considers draft Bills from individual NCOP members and provincial legislatures.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPetitions may also be tabled in Parliament and referred to the relevant committee that deals with the issue raised in the petition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Internal Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Assembly has a number of internal committees that deal with matters affecting the running of Parliament. The Committees normally consist of senior Members of Parliament. The Rules Committee and its sub-committees deal with House rules, the budget of the House, support for Members, internal arrangements, and powers and privileges of members. Other internal Committees are the Programme Committee that plans the work of the Assembly, the Disciplinary Committee, and the Committee of Chairpersons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe National Council of Provinces has its own domestic Committees. The Rules Committee and its subcommittees deal with the NCOP rules, the NCOP budget, parliamentary privileges, internal arrangements, international relations and delegated legislation.

        "body": "<p><strong>South African Institute for Advanced Constitutional, Public, Human Rights and International Law (SAIFAC) at the University of Johannesburg</strong><br />\r\nMr David Bilchitz, Professor, University of Johannesburg and Director, South African Institute for Advanced Constitutional, Public, Human Rights and International Law (SAIFAC) stated that the submission was supported by The South African Veterinary Association, the University of Pretoria, Faculty of Veterinary Sciences and the Centre for Applied Legal Studies, University of Witwatersrand. India had recently banned the training and exhibition of five wild animals including bears, tigers and monkeys, following recommendation by an expert committee. It took into consideration evidence of suffering that comes with training animals particularly for circuses. He gave examples of cruel training methods used on animals. The Constitutional Court had ruled that licences in terms of the Performing Animals Protection Act (PAPA) should not be conceived of as a judicial function but by the Executive. Placing this power within the Executive required attention to the manner in which it was regulated. The PAPA should protect the wellbeing of animals and the original Act dated back to 1935 and was out-dated due to scientific developments regarding the welfare of animals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Bilchitz gave an overview of the submission. The Bill had to clarify the purpose of the Act and provide clear guiding factors in the law in which decisions were made by the National Licencing Officer. It had to ensure that the decision maker was an expert in animal welfare and only allow delegation to experts in that area. Opportunities had to be granted for democratic participation in the licencing process to enable maximum information to be acquired and transparency. It should include reptiles and aquatic animals such as dolphins. It should criminalise cruelty in terms of the Act and declare persons convicted of cruelty unfit to take charge of an animal. It should make provision for the upkeep costs on those who wish to use animals and it should enable the Minister to regulate and ban certain practices. The purpose of the Act lacked clarity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe exhibition and training activity should not cause harm to the physical, emotional and psychological welfare of the animal. Provision should be made for the welfare of the animal after the performance had ceased and provision for its welfare if the licence was not granted. The current provision stated that an animal scientist or a veterinarian could make decisions on licencing. It was unclear what was meant by the phrase &ldquo;animal scientist&rdquo;. What qualifications were necessary to be an animal scientist? This could include people in agriculture who worked with animals and those who worked on the cell biology of animals in the laboratory. The Bill should include animals in zoos, horse shows and bird shows as they were also animals in entertainment. Section 7 should be amended to allow the Minister to prohibit a performing or exhibition activity which could reasonably be shown to be detrimental to the welfare of animals. He further elaborated on all the changes that were proposed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><em>Discussion</em></strong><br />\r\nMs D Steyn (COPE) asked if Mr Bilchitz had made a presentation to the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) and if any proposals at the time were included in the current form.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr M Filtane (UDM) referred to the recommendation that a licencing officer should be someone who had expert knowledge on animal welfare. Why should that be the case? It was suggested that acts of cruelty to animals should qualify one to be criminalised. Does a magistrate have to have expert knowledge on the social elements of a human being before he could deliberate on a case? Could one not confine themselves to the specific requirements of a licence? Animal welfare could be very diverse and so were the needs of human beings.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs D Carter (COPE) asked for clarity on the definition of &lsquo;any animal&rsquo; because that could be a huge definition. She made reference to the aspect of animals for entertainment and asked what happened to the South Africa Police Service (SAPS) dogs and the rats that were trained to go to Burundi and take out landmines. Would they also have to be licenced?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr T Ramokhoase (ANC) asked for clarity on the notion of expertise. Was it at the highest level of expertise or not because in the field of experts there were levels?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Bilchitz replied that he had made a presentation last year in a workshop held by DAFF and the law had improved from the first draft that was seen. The Department was responsive to some of the input that was provided but not sufficiently so.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs far as expertise was concerned, he gave an analogy of children in court. If judges did not understand issues around children, they drew in expertise such as family advocates and social workers to do a review in relation to the child. Animals could not tell us about their needs and they were extremely vulnerable creatures. Science had shown that it was not that simple to judge whether an animal was happy or not. There were many issues to take into consideration such as its living conditions and its origin. Not any ordinary person could necessarily know that just from looking at an animal or the environment, therefore some level of expertise was required. It could be provided in the law that a decision maker could draw in the necessary expertise in making a decision. If there was pressure to grant a licence were people going to have an enquiry? It would be better to have somebody who already had the expertise to make the decision. The important thing was that the law covered those animals which were used in the industry and those that had interests that may be affected; to whom there could be cruelty.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nReptiles and aquatic animals should be included or any other animals such as octopi, which science had shown to need welfare. The law should cover all areas in which animals were involved in entertainment and those kept for exhibition. Expertise required was not only that of vets as that would be too restrictive. There were people who were trained in animal welfare who were not vets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Carter asked how security animals such as police dogs would fall in the Act.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Bilchitz replied that currently animals used in the military and the police were excluded. It would be a good idea that those animals were also subject to some regulation to ensure that they were treated well. That could be done separately and not in terms of the existing provision.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr M Filtane (UDM) asked that given that South Africa was multicultural was there no possibility that if a licencing officer had to be typically qualified, the culture of that particular person could be the driving force behind granting or refusing licences?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Bilchitz said that it was important to have diverse decision makers across race, culture and gender in order to avoid cultural biases influencing decisions. Animal welfare was not something that was purely culturally dependent. There was a scientific fact or answer to whether or not an animal was suffering in its particular environment or not.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>The National Council Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals</strong><br />\r\nMr Andries Venter, Senior Inspector, National Council of Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA), presented the organisation&rsquo;s comments on the current draft bill for the PAPA. He outlined the role of the NSPCA. The NSPCA identified that there was a lack of knowledge in magistrates issuing licences across the country and magistrates were being abused by applicants. If one applicant was refused a licence they would go to another magistrate who would then issue the licence which was valid either nationally or locally depending on the magistrate&rsquo;s discretion. The legislation needed to be revised. Some exhibitions and performances caused harm to animals and were still allowed to go ahead through magistrates issuing those licences. There was a severe lack of consultation of magistrates with experts or skilled people in the relevant areas.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe legal team advised the NSPCA that the Act was old and that it was an administrative function just like a liquor licence and a better system needed to be put in place. The Constitutional Court ruled only on Sections 2 and 3 where it related to magistrates therefore the DAFF was instructed through Parliament to concentrate efforts towards those two areas.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe purpose of the Act was to prevent animals from suffering and to protect performing animals. It also entailed public protection. If an animal was scared the public was in danger. If there were incompetent handlers and unacceptable methods of training, these performances became cruel. Skilled persons had to be part of the licencing and appeals process. Animal welfare experience was essential and one who was not experienced in the field would not know what to look for or what questions to ask. Environmental affairs and wild animals should be considered. If a licencing officer issued a licence for lions or elephants in one province and that licence was valid elsewhere in the country, there would be clashes with provincial legislations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe draft currently read: 3E (1) the National Licencing officer may delegate any of his or her functions under the Act to an expert or other person appointed in terms of section 3D. Mr Venter proposed the insertion after 3D &lsquo;&hellip;except for the issuing, granting or reinstating of a licence.&rsquo; The scrutiny, issuing and granting of licences should be centralised at the national office to prevent bias.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Act had to include that there had to be physical inspection of the premises, accommodation, equipment and facilities where the acts were performed by the animals. The number of hours per day that the animal would be required to perform or exhibited should be indicated. A disaster management report from the local district or municipal disaster management commander was important because some performances involved large crowds but there was no disaster management input and that should be considered in the legislation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Environmental Management Systems Foundation submission</strong><br />\r\nMs Michele Pickover, Director, Environmental Management Systems (EMS) Foundation, stated that there was an urgent need for improved legislation on animal protection in South Africa. The PAPA and the Animal Protection Act (APA) were out-dated and had critical weaknesses in interpretation, application, administration, <em>locus standi</em> and enforcement. DAFF appeared not to have jurisdiction to investigate animal cruelty or take action against it. This it outsourced solely to Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). Permits for the movement of wild animals and the permits allowing animals to be held needed to be substantially more specific in terms of welfare and protection requirements and must include conditions which facilitated welfare inspection.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEMS Foundation wanted to make a specific intervention in relation to elephants because the captive elephant industry obtained licences for their activities through PAPA but PAPA did not protect elephants in captivity. There was lack of clarity in terms of which government department was responsible for the keeping and management of elephants in captivity. Current research revealed that information about elephants in captivity was not known or kept by national or provincial government including DAFF. There were 129 elephants in captivity in South Africa. 22 were owned by private individuals or companies and two state entities (the Johannesburg Zoo and the National Zoological Zoo in Pretoria). Five individuals or companies owned 53% of these elephants. Almost every elephant in captivity in South Africa had been taken from the wild as a baby or juvenile, kidnapped and forcibly removed from its family.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere was a concern for elephants because they were highly social. They were vulnerable to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and therefore vulnerable to suffering in a captive setting. This information meant there should be ethical consideration in current policies and legislation. In South Africa, the captive elephant industry had a history of cruel, abusive and domination training and deaths of handlers. The elephant-back safari industry used a dominance-based free contact approach to elephant control. This involved the use of a variety of tools such as bull hooks, and methods that caused intense distress, pain and injury. Negative reinforcement techniques were part of the training. Prevention of use of elephants in captivity for circuses and elephant-back safaris would not have a significant economic or negative tourism impact.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Ban Animal Trading comments on the PAPA</strong><br />\r\nMs Smaragda Louw, Director, Ban Animal Trading (BAT) stated that processes needed to be in place to ensure that the welfare of the animals was monitored. Any committee that was tasked with granting and issuing PAPA permits should have at least one member representing the rights of animals. The organization was opposed to the commercialization of animals. The focus in this submission was on animals that were used for commercial gain in circuses specifically. The organization proposed an unqualified ban on the use of all animals in circuses. Several countries in Europe including Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands now prohibited the use of wild animals in circuses and countries such as Greece prohibited the use of all animals in the circus.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn South Africa in 2001 a handler was killed by a circus elephant and in 2013 an alligator escaped from a circus enclosure in Port Elizabeth. Animals in the circus spend most of their time in confinement. Training of circus animals happened behind closed doors. If positive reinforcement methods were used for training then trainers would walk around with treats and not whips. The circus played no role in conservation and had no educational purpose. Research showed that animals were conscious and emotional beings to the same degree as humans. Intentional cruelty must be criminalized and exploitation of animals in circuses must be banned.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>South African Dog Academy submission</strong><br />\r\nMr Nicholas Minnie, Director, South African Dog Academy (SADA), said that training methods included force, bribe, repetition, play and master-dog methods. Humans were also trained all the time and if one did something wrong they were fined or imprisoned. On behalf of SADA Access Control, the security industry under the control of Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority (PSIRA) and South African National Security Employers Association (SANSEA) the proposal was that the use of animals for safeguarding should be excluded from the proposed amendment. Prior to 1989, the various security companies and the above mentioned associations together with the NSPCA representatives agreed to propose regulations for guard dogs and handlers. Trust was broken when the NSPCA went directly to the Department of Justice and provided a different interpretation to the agreement which resulted in the industry being added to the PAPA as a last resort.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSADG did not train dogs but it trained people and there were special dogs for training purposes. If the organization was included in the PAPA then all dog or animal training facilities were incorporated in PAPA as well. That included the police and welfare organizations. Under the regulations, the movement of animals should be a record done after the movement of the animals so that in the event of an illegal act, the particular dog could be identified.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>South African Veterinary Association submission</strong><br />\r\nMr John Austin, doctor, South African Veterinary Association (SAVA), stated that the PAPA legislation that was now 70 years old and no longer served to protect the interests of animals. Magistrates were not qualified to adjudicate licences. Section 3 described the licencing officer as a veterinarian or animal scientist.&nbsp; The PAPA stated that veterinarians may not permit themselves to be exploited in a manner which may be detrimental to an animal, to the client or to the profession. This put veterinarians in a very difficult situation where they had to adjudicate the interests of three different groups. The harm which was caused by humans to animals stemmed from ignorance, indifference, insensitivity, greed and power. Only persons who were qualified to make judgement in considering the applications for licences in terms of the Act should be appointed to do so. SAVA was mindful of the need of its profession to be centrally involved in an adjudicating and advisory capacity as executive officers through the appointment of veterinarians to the office of National Licencing Officer as experts delegated to perform the function. It rejected the proposal that animal scientists as contemplated and defined in the Amendment Bill were suitably or uniformly qualified in knowledge and expertise to function alongside veterinarians as licencing officers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Private submission</strong><br />\r\nMr Hendrik du Toit, retired Senior Technician, Department of Water Affairs, stated that affected persons should be able to object to the licence and not interested persons but the court should decide on that. There should be regulations such that people who wanted to train animals knew what was involved beforehand and not later on because building facilities was an expensive venture and to have it later condemned would be a loss. There must be public participation in the framing of regulations and these should be subjected to Parliament for final approval. They should be published so that people were aware of what was happening. The Appeal Board which was not supported by The Constitution should be replaced by an independent tribunal whose chairperson must be a lawyer with a panel that comprised people with knowledge such as veterinarians. The definitions in the Act were not very clear. There was use of wrong words such as &lsquo;the safeguarding of animals&rsquo; instead of animals used for safeguarding.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>United Front 4 Animals submission</strong><br />\r\nMs Nikki Elliot, Founder and Director, United Front 4 Animals (UFA), stated that their submission was focused mostly on circus animals and the issuing of licences to circuses. Cruelty was inherent in travelling circuses. There was a focus in legislation, on the cruelty rather than the welfare of animals. The Committee accepted and endorsed as guiding principles among others, the five basic freedoms which were freedom from hunger, thirst and malnutrition; freedom from fear and distress; freedom from physical and thermal discomfort; freedom from pain, injury and disease; and freedom to express normal patterns of behaviour. There were no criteria for any licencing officer to take into account what constituted &lsquo;fit and proper&rsquo; licence applicants. No circus owner could be regarded as fit and proper for various reasons. The organization supported the ban called for by BAT but if the Committee decided that animal circuses should still have licences then only a veterinarian with a suitable animal welfare and behaviour qualification should be recommended to issue licences for all performing animals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><em>Discussion</em></strong><br />\r\nMr L Ntshayisa (AIC) asked the SADA for clarity on the notion that the organization did not train dogs but trained people instead. Were these people trained in order to train animals or were dogs not trained at all? If that was the case then how were the dogs expected to perform if they were not trained? The UFA had proposed banning animals in circuses and yet the organization supported the Bill Amendment. Where then should the animals perform if they were not allowed in circuses?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Carter stated that in the 1930s the PAPA was specifically aimed at circuses but at the moment there were five circuses, three of which had animals, but it was the rest of the industry that was being affected. These included security dogs and not about the circuses. What was going to happen in agricultural shows, zoos and oceanariums as those too fell under &lsquo;any animal&rsquo;? This would affect not just three licences but possibly 17 000 others. Where did the recent case of juvenile elephants take place?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr M Filtane (UDM) asked what problems were anticipated with regards to the relocation of animals for use. Was there any proof that the stress that these animals have had to put up with was beyond their capacity, perhaps beyond that of human beings? The question was asked because there seemed to be an overemphasis on the fact that the animals were being ill-treated. Human beings when striving to get something, were also subjected to certain levels of stress therefore why was that such a big issue? Was there any proof that this stress lasted beyond a certain period of time or it was there during training or performing?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs A Steyn (DA) stated that many of the presentations were made for something that was not on the table. If the Bill in its current form with maybe a few amendments was to be put in place, would these amendments strengthen the Bill? At this stage the focus was on the licencing aspect and how that should be done. It was important to have a register of who received licences and what the licence was for. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr P Mabe (ANC) asked whether legislation should make it standard that there should be welfare officers. He requested clarity on whether stakeholders were contesting having magistrates playing the licencing role or they were suggesting bringing some expert opinion as it related to the issue of licences, especially for performing animals. The legislation still stated the magistrate as the licencing authority.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Z Jongbloed (DA) asked Mr Minnie for clarity on his idea that a PAPA licence would cost R30 and take approximately nine months and on the R54 million that was mentioned.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson added that they were dealing with the amendment of the Bill and the focus was only on relieving judiciary services of their duty to award licences and giving the task to relevant administrators, which was DAFF in this context. She highlighted that the Department had indicated to the Committee that it was working on an animal welfare Bill which was what some of the presentations focused on. The licencing process should be strengthened such that it was not subject to abuse.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Pickover responded that she took some of the photographs herself in Limpopo and Eden in Knysna. The problem was that there was no monitoring and that was what the legislation would hopefully accomplish and there would be access to the places. The licencing process should be fixed and ultimately the overall legislation. She asked Members to ensure access to information around the licencing process was a key component because it was almost impossible for NGOs to monitor what went on in these industries. Having just a veterinarian as a licencing officer would be completely wrong because veterinarians were part of the industry and were sometimes responsible for some of the cruelty involved. They did not abide by a proper code of ethics that spoke to animal welfare. Behavioural experts should be brought in specifically in relation to elephants. There was a lot of research by psychologists around PTSD and it was in the same environment as animals therefore from a moral standpoint elephants were similar.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Minnie replied that his remark on training people and not dogs was not to be taken literally. He explained that in the police force for dog training or evaluation a dog was taken through the whole training process for three months. One handler could handle dogs that were at different training standards in a day. Some handlers could have six to eight dogs in a training session. &nbsp;Not all training establishments did the same. There was a general profile that was filled in for accreditation and it was audited by a responsible person who was trained to do that. The instructors went up to grade five, which was the substance detection work.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe suggested that the state veterinarian be the final authority in the licencing. If procedures were followed, a clerk should be able to issue a licence. A licence should be declined for serious reasons and not trivial ones. The NSPCA had come up with regulations that were difficult to comply with. There was no law that regulated those statements by the NSPCA. The Licenced Animal Training Association (LATA) proposed that even the local veterinarian could give a permit. This could be taken to the state veterinarian for counter signing. That was where the R30 cost came in. One could only go to the magistrate of their magisterial district for a licence. If a magistrate of another district issued a licence then that magistrate would not be doing their job correctly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Austin replied that in the situation of the PAPA the National Licencing Officer and people delegated with powers to administer the Act must be independent. Clearly they would not be paid by clients. If veterinarians were part of any problem concerning animal welfare, that would be contrary to the values of the profession. It ought to be formally reported. He replied that he was not aware of any complaints being reported to the South African Veterinary Council about these particular issues. Until such complaints were made it was difficult to respond specifically to the comment. Organisations such as the EMS were encouraged to bring it to the attention of the regulating authority.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Louw responded that dogs that were confined in small kennels and were trained using means of negative training became traumatised and when they were rescued rehabilitation took time. This was more extreme with wild animals that were made to do things that were completely not in their nature such as sitting on bar stools and jumping through hoops. The organization was against the use of wild animals in the circus but if the permit process did go through it should be an open process. The organization would like to see what the terms and conditions for the licences would be and asked that on all the committees somebody from an animal rights organization be present to represent the interests of the animals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Venter replied that the problems they faced included that animals were trained and then stationed at different locations and not necessarily at the same facility where the licence was applied from. Those sights need to be checked to ensure they could accommodate the type of animal and how the animals would live in those environments or whether they would live there or be moved around. If these comments were taken into consideration then the NSPCA would be happy with the Bill. Experts were needed in the adjudication process especially where wild animals were concerned.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Elliot added that circus animals should not perform at all. No animals should be made to do tricks and South Africa should join the more than 40 countries and states that have banned the practice of animals performing. Stereotypical behaviour such as swaying in elephants and pacing in tigers and lions was evidence of stress. It was well documented and much had been written about it. Even outside captivity they were difficult to rehabilitate. Concerning the licencing procedure, the Act should be strengthened and there should be a procedure where a properly qualified person was appointed as licencing officer, preferably a veterinarian who was qualified in welfare and behaviour of animals including wild animals. All organizations should be able to make submissions to the licencing officer if they felt that the licence should not be issued.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson excused the stakeholders from the meeting, the Members of the Committee remained behind.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Report of the Portfolio Committee on Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries on the International Fisheries Agreement that binds the Republic of South Africa dated 12 May 2015</strong><br />\r\nThe Chairperson stated that Members had to look at the international agreement that was tabled by the Department. The Department had clarified issues that were of concern to the Members and the Chairperson wanted to check with the Members if the report could be adopted. The Secretary read the report<br />\r\nThe agreement was on the establishment of Indian Tuna Ocean Tuna Commission, for the conservation of the Southern Bluefin tuna. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization wanted to take measures to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. The Committee previously could not finalise the agreement because the explanatory memorandum that accompanied the International Agreement was not prepared according to the National Assembly&rsquo;s rule 3062 and the Department of International Relations and Cooperation&rsquo;s (DIRCO) guidelines. Legal opinions regarding the alignment and lack of consistency of the agreement with domestic laws and other international obligations of the country from both the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development and DIRCO were out-dated. The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) did not provide adequate information on all three agreements including financial implications and contribution to job creation. The Committee resolved to give the DAFF more time to provide parliament with the required information.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Committee made a decision on the International Agreement and recommended that Parliament approves the international agreement.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson adjourned the meeting.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "summary": "<p>Various stakeholders submitted their contributions to the Bill Amendment. Key issues that were raised were that the Bill was old and no longer fully served its purpose which was to protect the welfare and wellbeing of animals. There were issues on its lack of clarity in defining certain parameters and its use of vague terminology. One of the major issues raised was the process of licencing of those who wished to use animals for entertainment. What were the requirements and what procedures would be followed? Who was best qualified to issue such licences and on what grounds? Some stated that the country should ban the use of animals in circuses or in entertainment as this led to cruelty to animals because of the methods used for training. Others called for a more transparent licencing process that would protect the welfare of the animals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nReptiles, aquatic animals or any other animals such as octopi, which science had shown to need welfare, should be included in the Bill. Currently animals used in the military and the police were excluded. It would be a good idea that those animals were also subject to some regulation to ensure that they were treated well. There must be public participation in the framing of regulations and these should be submitted to Parliament for final approval.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the discussion stakeholders raised the question of whether or not veterinarians were the most suitable professionals to adjudicate the licencing of animals. There was need for experts who understood the welfare and behaviour of animals in order to perform the function and just a qualification in veterinary science did not necessarily mean one would be a suitable licencing officer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMembers asked several questions around the issue of licencing. They queried whether a licencing officer needed expert knowledge on animal welfare, and asked whether legislation should make it standard that there should be welfare officers. They requested clarity on whether stakeholders were contesting having magistrates playing the licencing role or they were suggesting bringing some expert opinion as it related to the issue of licences, especially for performing animals.<br />\r\nSome Members asked if the culture of licencing officers would play a role in granting or refusing licences, and what evidence there was of psychological trauma in the animals. They were concerned about the use of the all-encompassing phrase &ldquo;all animals&rdquo; in the Bill, as the PAPA was originally specifically aimed at circuses but would be broadened to affect other industries such as security dogs, agricultural shows, zoos and oceanariums.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The concern was around the 1.6 million households benefiting from the Food and Nutrition Security initiatives by 2019 and the 4.3 million people that were insecure in 2014.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Nokuzola Mgxashe, Committee Content Researcher, said the 1, 6 million households represent 4, 3 million individuals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Filtane also commented that Outcome 7 seems to be reporting on something that has happened.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Mgxashe explained that Outcome 7 talks to rural development and food security. These are the activities the Department takes note of and should respond to.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Filtane further asked for clarity on the issue of 1 million hectares of under-utilised land because it appeared to him the problem lay with year 2013.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson explained that the transfer of the land is still to happen in 2019. In 2013 4 million hectares were under-utilised. 1 million of that 4 million has to be utilised by 2019.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs A Steyn (DA), on P.21, commented that the discussion of the Committee regarding OBP was about the functions of the entity (OBP) in looking after the health of animals. It was not about funding.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Filtane, on P.21 (8.2), suggested the Department should present its plans to the Committee in June rather than August on how it is going to align its plans and targets seeing that its budget has been reduced.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn agreed with Mr Filtane.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson, on P.21 (8.4), felt the end of July for the presentation of the Integrated Funding Model to the Committee is very early. The Committee still needs to have a meeting with the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn suggested the month of September. The Committee agreed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson suggested that item 8.4 and 8.5 should be combined because they go together &ndash; the Integrated Funding Model and APAP. She further suggested that 8.6 be removed because the issue of funding reductions has been stated under Committee Resolution on P.21.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Filtane, on P.22 (8.10) suggested the wording that reads: &ldquo;poor control of the Act&rdquo; should be corrected because an Act cannot be controlled. It is implemented.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Mgxashe apologised and said the line is supposed to read: &ldquo;poor control measures in the administration of the Act&rdquo;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson suggested that the DAFF should brief the Committee about the poor control measures in the administration of the Act in August.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe report was adopted with amendments. The EFF rejected the report.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>International Fisheries Agreement</strong><br />\r\nMs Siphokazi Ndudane, Acting Deputy Director-General in Fisheries Management: DAFF, said her presentation was attempting to address the concerns the Committee raised and to assist it to consider the request of DAFF for South Africa to accede to the Fisheries Agreements. The three agreements in question are: Agreement for the Establishment of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) and the Port State Measures Agreement (PSMA).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are no amendments that have taken place in all three agreements since the State Law Advisors reviewed them and the initial opinion that was given remains the property of the Departments of Justice and Constitutional Development (DoJCD) and International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO). The opinion states that the three Fisheries Agreements are not in conflict with South African law.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Agreements are all multilateral instruments and with respect to signature there is one master copy that is signed and is held by the Depositary. Consequently, there would not be a South African text that needs to be printed on South African treaty paper. On how these agreements would have an impact on Operation Phakisa, the DIRCO noted that because the Agreements aim to establish the best international practice with respect to the conservation, management and sustainable use of marine resources are understood to be in line with the objectives of Operation Phakisa.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConcerning accession or ratification to the PSMA, it is reported that the agreement was open for signature until 21 November 2010 and no party could ratify the agreement beyond 21 November 2010 and, therefore, South Africa can only accede. On 19 August 2015, 11 countries ratified the agreement. On the issue of providing assistance to developing states by PSMA, South Africa is a developing country and has already received support from the Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMO) particularly with regard to training and attendance of RFMO meetings.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the matter of denying access to South African ports, it stated that South Africa has implemented certain segments of the PSMA through the requirements of the RFMO. These measures are limited as they only deal with species under the purview of the relevant RFMO. The same capacity that is currently being used to implement port state measures under the RFMO would largely be used to implement the United Nations&rsquo; Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) PSMA.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn terms of queries raised in respect of the Explanatory Memo, these responses were provided:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The history, objective and implications of the Agreement should be briefly set out.</li>\r\n\t<li>The Office of the Director-General obtained the Cabinet minutes of 7 August 2013, which were provided to the Chairperson of the Committee. The document is classified and cannot be distributed widely.</li>\r\n\t<li>All agreements have self-executing provisions that would become law in the Republic in terms of Section 321 (4) of the Constitution upon the approval of the Agreement by Parliament.</li>\r\n\t<li>DAFF has appended 3 separate Opinions from DIRCO and DoJCD and each details the International Fisheries Agreements to the submitted combined Explanatory Memo.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Acceding to the IOTC and CCSBT Agreements would provide direct benefit to the economy of South Africa and indirect benefit to vulnerable groups. It is believed this would create jobs and improve the quality of jobs from seasonal to permanent. The PSMA is striving to create a network of port states to fight the Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (IUU) and these would serve to provide additional protection of marine resources of Africa from being plundered by foreign IUU vessels. Reduced IUU would increase the amount of marine resources to be used by South Africa in general.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is also stated that South Africa is allowed to participate in meetings but the level of participation is limited because non-contracting parties are not allowed to submit written proposals to be considered by the members. In CCSBT, South Africa is not allowed into the negotiations of SBT quota. It must be noted that all decisions of the RFMO are taken by 100% consensus of its member parties, and this means if South Africa acceded, the country would be in a stronger position regarding the tabling of quota proposals and objecting to those that are not equitable. At this stage, South Africa has limited power to influence decisions of member parties because she is a non-contracting party.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMembership Fees<br />\r\nThe location of the secretariat determines the currency of the membership fees. CCSBT is based in Australia and operates in Australian Dollars while the IOTC is based in the Seychelles and operates in United States Dollars. Membership fees are determined annually by a specific formula adopted by the respective RFMO. Factors that affect membership fees include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>World Bank classification</li>\r\n\t<li>Historical catches</li>\r\n\t<li>Annual overall budget determined by the RFMO</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>On how important it is for South Africa to accede to CSSBT and IOTC, current figures reveal that South Africa has around 230 vessels in the Large Pelagic (163 tuna pole and 50 long-line). The long-line fishery creates around 400 direct jobs on board these vessels. A total income of R24 million was generated during the 2014/15 period from the current 40-ton for SBT. If South Africa acceded to CCSBT in 2015, the allocation would have been about 150 ton. This translates to nearly R100 million which translates to an increase in the number of jobs. The Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) is a high value fish. One SBT was sold for R20 million in Japan, but South Africa did not make money from that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe access at the IOTC area is effort regulated. The long-line vessel limitation of South Africa in the IOTC Area is 50 vessels and this would remain in place until 2019. New negotiations would take place in 2019 and it is important to have South Africa accede, otherwise the country would lose out again.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPertaining to the available enforcement resources, the Department has got three Inshore Patrol Vessels and one offshore vessel. These vessels are equipped with RHIBs that are necessary for boarding and performing inspections at sea. Fishery Control Officers have continuous training in Safety at Sea, First Aid at Sea, Fire fighting at Sea and boarding vessels at sea in addition to legislation, regulations, permit conditions and port state measures. Most of the inspectors have been recruited from enforcement agencies such as SAPS and SARS. However, none are trained in respect of training guidelines as outlined in Annex E of the Agreement. This training would be covered under article 21 in order to develop capacity for developing countries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn her conclusion Ms Ndudane highlighted that the tuna long-line fishery has the potential to become the third most economically important fishery in South Africa after the hake and small pelagic fisheries. It is one of the few fisheries in South Africa that has a realistic opportunity for growth in the short term, but it is largely dependent on the government providing an enabling environment and, amongst other things, accession to relevant conventions like IOTC and CCSBT.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn as far as acceding to the FAO PSMA is concerned, the world is affixed on South Africa to accede to this instrument in a global attempt to fight IUU fisheries because South Africa is recognised as a globally important port state which is already implementing most aspects of the Port State Measures Agreement. Therefore, it is recommended that Parliamentary approval be granted for South Africa to accede to the IOTC, CCSBT and PSMA.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><em>Discussion</em></strong><br />\r\nMs Z Jongbloed (DA) asked if other costs are incurred besides the membership fees, and if an increase in quota is not going to affect the sustainability of tuna fishing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Ndudane said there are costs that are incurred. They are for attending meetings. There are two types of meetings &ndash; Commission and Inter-Sessional Meetings. Two delegates are sent to each meeting. Regarding the issue of sustainability, there would be no effect at all because more is going to be taken from those countries that have more tuna like Korea, Japan, Indonesia and Australia.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr C Maxegwana (ANC) asked what South Africa could do to get a fair share of the tuna tonnage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Ndudane reported that all regional fisheries organisations operate in the UN style of governance. South Africa needs to accede to the IOTC and CCSBT Agreements in order to increase its participation and make strategic decisions on issues it is going to table in those international sessions or meetings.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe meeting was adjourned.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "summary": "<p>One Southern Bluefin Tuna from the South African waters was sold for R20 million in Japan. Unfortunately, South Africa did not make money from the transaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Fisheries Management Division of the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) tabled this revelation before the Portfolio Committee on Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries when it was briefing the Committee about its international fishing agreements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The presentation was an attempt to address concerns the Committee raised regarding the matter and to assist it to consider the request of DAFF for South Africa to accede to the Fisheries Agreements. The three agreements in question are: Agreement for the Establishment of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) and the Port State Measures Agreement (PSMA).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was reported that no amendments have taken place in all three agreements since the State Law Advisors reviewed them and the initial opinion given remains the property of the Departments of Justice and Constitutional Development (DoJCD) and International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO). The opinion states that the three Fisheries Agreements are not in conflict with South African law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Acceding to the IOTC and CCSBT Agreements would provide direct benefit to the economy of South Africa and indirect benefit to vulnerable groups. It is believed this would create jobs and improve the quality of jobs from seasonal to permanent. The PSMA is striving to create a network of port states to fight the Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (IUU) and these would serve to provide additional protection of marine resources of Africa from being plundered by foreign IUU vessels. Reduced IUU would increase the amount of marine resources to be used by South African in general.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the importance for South Africa to accede to CSSBT and IOTC, current figures reveal that South Africa has around 230 vessels in the Large Pelagic (163 tuna pole and 50 long-line). The long-line fishery creates around 400 direct jobs on board these vessels. A total income of R24 million was generated during the 2014/15 period from the current 40-ton for Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT). If South Africa acceded to CCSBT in 2015, the allocation would have been about 150 ton. This translates to nearly R100 million which translates to an increase in the number of jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Committee adopted the draft report on the strategic plans, annual performance plans and budget of DAFF and its entities for the 2015/15 financial year with amendments. The EFF rejected the report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members asked for clarity around the 1.6 million households benefiting from the Food and Nutrition Security initiatives by 2019 and the 4.3 million people that were insecure in 2014; asked for clarity on the issue of 1 million hectares of under-utilised land; and suggested the Department should present to the Committee in June on how it is going to align its plans and targets seeing that its budget has been reduced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On international fishing agreements, Members asked what South Africa can do to get a fair share of the tuna tonnage; if there are other costs incurred besides the membership fees; and if an increase in quota is not going to affect the sustainability of tuna fishing.</p>\r\n",

Committee meetings are open to the public, but may be closed if there is a good reason to do so.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>The different committees have one or more of the following functions:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>They monitor and oversee the work and budgets of national government departments and hold them accountable They consider and amend Bills, and may initiate Bills They consider private members&#39; and provincial legislative proposals and special petitions They consider international treaties and agreements They examine specifi c areas of public life or matters of public interest They take care of domestic parliamentary issues Committees have the power to summon any person to appear before them, give evidence or produce documents. They may require any person or institution to report to them. Committees may also receive petitions, representations or submissions from the public. Each Committee is headed by a Chairperson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>THE DIFFERENT COMMITTEES OF PARLIAMENT</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Portfolio Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Assembly (NA) appoints from among its members a number of Portfolio Committees to shadow the work of the various national government departments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>The role of Portfolio Committees is to:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>consider Bills, deal with departmental budget votes, oversee the work of the department they are responsible for, and enquire and make recommendations about any aspect of the department, including its structure, functioning and policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe work of Committees is not restricted to government. They may investigate any matter of public interest that falls within their area of responsibility. There is a Portfolio Committee for each national Ministry and its associated government department/s.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Select Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Council of Provinces (NCOP) appoints from its permanent members a number of Select Committees to shadow the work of the various national government departments and to deal with Bills.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause only 54 of the 90 NCOP Members are permanent delegates compared to the 400 of the NA, the Select Committees oversee the work of more than one national government department.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Public Accounts Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Assembly Standing Committee on Public Accounts acts as Parliament&#39;s watchdog over the way taxpayers&#39; money is spent by the Executive. Every year the Auditor-General tables reports on the accounts and financial management of the various government departments and State institutions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHeads of government departments and institutions are regularly called by this committee to report and account for expenditure. The Committee can recommend that the National Assembly takes corrective actions if necessary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Members&#39; Legislative Proposals and Petitions Committees</strong><br />\r\nDraft bills can be submitted by individual Members of the National Assembly. These bills are considered by the National Assembly&#39;s Standing Committee on Private Member&#39;s Legislative Proposals and Special Petitions. If the Committee agrees with the principle of the draft Bill, a Bill will be prepared and dealt with by Parliament.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe National Council of Provinces Select Committee on Members&#39; and Provincial Legislative Proposals considers draft Bills from individual NCOP members and provincial legislatures.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPetitions may also be tabled in Parliament and referred to the relevant committee that deals with the issue raised in the petition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Internal Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Assembly has a number of internal committees that deal with matters affecting the running of Parliament. The Committees normally consist of senior Members of Parliament. The Rules Committee and its sub-committees deal with House rules, the budget of the House, support for Members, internal arrangements, and powers and privileges of members. Other internal Committees are the Programme Committee that plans the work of the Assembly, the Disciplinary Committee, and the Committee of Chairpersons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe National Council of Provinces has its own domestic Committees. The Rules Committee and its subcommittees deal with the NCOP rules, the NCOP budget, parliamentary privileges, internal arrangements, international relations and delegated legislation. The Programme Committee plans the work of the NCOP and the Committee of Chairpersons make recommendations about the functioning of Committees and other NCOP forums.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Ad hoc Committees</strong><br />\r\nParliament or one of its Houses may appoint an ad hoc (temporary) Committee when a special task must be done. When the task is complete, the Committee is dissolved.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Joint Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces together appoint a number of joint committees, for example the Constitutional Review Committee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and the Joint Standing Committee on Defence are statutory Committees. This means that they are established, by the Constitution or by an Act of Parliament, as well as in terms of the rules of Parliament.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe committees play a very important role in the process of building democracy and involving the public in the processes and activities of Parliament.</p>\r\n",

        "body": "<p><strong>Briefing by Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) on Performing Animals Protection Amendment (PAPA) Bill</strong><br />\r\nDr Tembile Songabe, Director of Veterinary Public Health, said the DAFF had presented the PAPA Bill to the Committee on 14 April 2015, at which Members and other parties had made some inputs, expressed some concerns, asked additional information and offered some suggestions concerning the Bill. DAFF&rsquo;s technical team had considered all the issues and wished to respond. However, the responses offered were not fixed, but rather an indication as to how DAFF thought about the Bill, and it also sought some input from the Committee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConcerns had been raised that the &ldquo;Objects of the Bill&rdquo; were inconsistent with the original Bill. They had therefore tried to reword the Objects of the Bill, as following:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>&ldquo;To amend the Performing Animals Protection Act, 1935, so as to insert certain definitions; to provide for the designation of a National Licensing Officer; to provide for a procedure for the application for a licence to exhibit and train performing animals or use of dogs for safeguarding; to provide for the functions of a National Licensing Officer; to provide for the issuance of licences; to provide for an appeals process; and to provide for matters connected herewith.&rdquo; </em>DAFF hoped that the concern had now been addressed with the new revision, but it also asked that the team of State Law Advisors, Parliamentary Legal Services and the Department&rsquo;s legal services have a discussion and reword the revision to the satisfaction of everyone.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere had also been a concern on the use of the term &ldquo;Any Animal&rdquo; which was used in the Bill, without qualifying which animals were involved. DAFF had also considered this matter and wished to clarify that as the current amendment dealt with only section 2 and section 3, all other sections in the Principal Act remained unchanged, as they were not part of the judgment. In this regard, the definition of an &ldquo;Animal&rdquo; remained the same definition as in the Principal Act, meaning the definition of an Animal (Section 11 of the Performing Animals Protection Act (PAPA), 1935 (Act No. 24 of 1935), read with Section 1 of the Animal Protection Act, (APA), 1962, Act No. 71 of 1962:<br />\r\n<em>&ldquo;Animal&rdquo; means any equine, bovine, sheep, goat, pig, fowl, ostrich, dog, cat, or other domestic animal or bird, or any wild animal or wild bird which was in captivity or under the control of any person.</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nConcerns had also been raised on Section 3D and 3E of the current Amendment Bill. These related to the potential loop-hole that could open the route for the appointment of &ldquo;malicious persons&rdquo; to potentially use their appointment to &ldquo;victimise&rdquo; certain industry stakeholders. The DAFF had considered the concern, and wished to clarify that Section 3D and 3E of the Bill were intended to assist DAFF and provinces where there was a lack of specific expertise, experience and knowledge within government to inspect a particular premise of certain animals in order to make a decision on issuance of a licence. DAFF was specifically concerned that there may be a shortage of skills within government when it came to wild animals. In this regard, the National Licensing Officer (NLO) may approach the Director General and request the appointment of such experts. The experts would be delegated by the NLO for such circumstances, for consultation and also where there was an appeal process that may require certain expertise.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOther concerns related to Section 3H of the current Amendment Bill. These related to the entering of the premises. DAFF would indicate that the inspection of premises would form an integral part of the application process &ndash; this would enable the official to gather adequate information so as to enable such an official to apply his/her mind regarding the issuance or decline of licences. All applicants must have their premises inspected. Entering of the premises by the NLO would be subject to the consent of the applicant, and it should also be noted that before issuance of a licence there would be minimum standards to be met.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Draft Bill which had been gazetted, the term &ldquo;National Executive Officer (NEO)&rdquo; had been used and stakeholders felt that this must be changed to &ldquo;National Licensing Officer (NLO).&rdquo; DAFF had agreed to the change. In the Draft Bill, the appointment of experts was originally done by the NEO, but stakeholders had felt that this must be the function of the Director General, at the request of the NLO. There had also been a request from stakeholders to insert Section 3L, &ldquo;Validity of the licence,&rdquo; and a request to delete Section 3F, &ldquo;Renewal of licence,&rdquo; and Section 3J, &ldquo;Notices and Summons&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The animals which were exempted from PAPA licencing, for Section 9 of the Principal Act, were:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Animals for military training</li>\r\n\t<li>Animals for police training</li>\r\n\t<li>Animals for sporting purposes</li>\r\n\t<li>Animals for agricultural shows</li>\r\n\t<li>Show horses</li>\r\n\t<li>Show dogs</li>\r\n\t<li>Show caged birds</li>\r\n\t<li>Military or police tournaments</li>\r\n\t<li>Gymkhanas</li>\r\n\t<li>Safeguarding dogs by the South African Defence or the South African Police or the Prisons Service</li>\r\n\t<li>Public Zoological Gardens</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>There had been a concern over the capacity of DAFF to carry out the functions, and the location of state veterinarians and animal scientists. Unfortunately, the current DAFF database on state veterinarians and animal scientists did not contain details of GPS coordinates. The map which they had was for 2010, and that was only for the state veterinarians, so an improved map showing the location of capacity would be provided later to reflect the status quo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other less obvious concerns raised by stakeholders were the mandate issue -- whether it should be done by DAFF or the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA), who the authors of the revised Bill would be, exemptions for a PAPA licence, the DAFF&rsquo;s capacity to implement licences, the selection and expertise of the appeals board, and what the purpose of the PAPA would be. Further details about these concerns were included in the minutes of the stakeholders workshop that had been submitted to the Committee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson said the Committee had not received the minutes of the stakeholders sorkshop. Nthing had been submitted to them.<br />\r\nMs Kanthi Nagiah, Chief Director of Legal Services, said the State Law Advisors (SLA) opinion that the Bill was a Section 75 Bill was based on the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Whether the Bill falls within a functional area listed in Schedule 4 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa (the Constitution) (Tongoane case);</li>\r\n\t<li>The impact of every/all the relevant provisions of the Bill must be assessed in determining whether the Bill substantially affects the provinces.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>When this was applied to PAPA, the following was apparent:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The only reason PAPA was being amended was a result of the Constitutional Court judgment. The major issue was who was responsible for the issuing of the licence;</li>\r\n\t<li>The Bill had placed the responsibility on the NLO, who was an official of the national department, and the NLO may in his/her discretion delegate this function to the province;</li>\r\n\t<li>No provision in the Bill compelled the province to perform any such function. Therefore, no provision in the Bill significantly/substantially impacted the province;</li>\r\n\t<li>It may be submitted that PAPA fell under the concurrent functions listed in Schedule 4 of the Constitution &ndash; Animal Control and Diseases and Nature Conservation. It would be incorrect, for reasons such as that:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The purpose of the Bill was to protect animals against abuse and was not for the control of animals and diseases. Further, the Bill cannot fall under the functional area of nature conservation because this refers to the protection of wildlife. The animals subject to the Bill would be under the control and in possession of the applicant for the licence. Such animals cannot be considered &ldquo;wildlife&rdquo; or wild animals. </em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe SLA also found that the Bill did not fall within Schedule 4. Given that the responsibility for the issuing of licences, and all other relevant provisions flowing therefrom resided with the national department, the Bill also did not substantially affect the provinces. The SLA also found that it would not be necessary to refer the Bill to the National House of Traditional Leaders, as the Bill did not contain provisions relating to customary law or customs of traditional communities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><em>Discussion</em></strong><br />\r\nMs A Steyn (DA) asked who had been responsible for the inspections before the Department took over, and why had it taken so long for the Department to respond to the Constitutional court regarding the Bill. She advised the Department that inspections should take place after a licence has been issued, and no visitations should be unannounced when an inspection took place. She asked if there may have been a lapse of responsibilities with what the SPCA had been doing. Where would the inspections take place -- where the animals were kept, or where they were put on display and performed?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr M Filtane (UDM) said there were inconsistencies on pages 5 and 10. The objective of the Bill included &ldquo;exhibit and train performing animals or use of dogs for safeguarding&rdquo;, but animals for police training had been exempted from the Bill when the police dogs were used for safeguarding themselves. Referring to bullet number 3 on page 11, he suggested that they should use the word &lsquo;updated&rsquo; instead of &ldquo;improved,&rdquo; because the word &ldquo;improved&rdquo; gave the impression that the map which they had used first had been incorrect, when it needed only to be updated. Who was responsible for the consultation processes, because it was important to hear the inputs of the stakeholders?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson made it clear to the Committee that it was their responsibility, not the Department&rsquo;s, to oversee the public hearings.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr L Ntshayisa (AIC) asked for a further explanation as to why the Bill would not be tabled to the House of Traditional Leaders, because some traditional healers in the rural areas had dogs which they bred.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Ramasodi replied that there had been a discussion on whether they should have merged the two Acts, or moved on with the Constitutional ruling, which was why so much time had been taken to respond to the ruling. They were committed to sending the minutes to the Committee regarding the workshop.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Songabe said the minimum standards for applying for a licence would apply, and there would be a process which the applicants would have to go through as well. Once an applicant had been granted a licence, they would have to adhere to further provisions which would follow for a licence holder, as the inspections would also be on-going. The inspections had previously been done by magistrates in the different provinces, and people were complaining that one magistrate was stricter than another in a different city. Other magistrates took the initiative of forwarding applications to animal welfare bodies so that they could make the approvals. However, some processes had been deemed to be unfair, so the Department had decided to take over the inspection process.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Nagiah said a substantial amount of the provisions in the Bill did not affect the House of Traditional Leaders.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Yolande van Aswegen, State Law Advisor, said before considering whether the Bill should be tabled with the House of Traditional Leaders, they had looked at what the customary law was and had found that there was no link in the Bill with the definition of customary law. Secondly, they had looked at what the purpose of the Bill was and how the usage of animals would infringe on the provisions of the Bill.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson said the Bill would not go through the House of Traditional Leaders, but that did not prevent traditional leaders from making proposals to the Committee during the public hearings.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNkosi Z Mandela (ANC) said he was confused, and asked for a further explanation of the reasons why the Bill was not being submitted to the House of Traditional Leaders.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Filtane suggested that they replace &ldquo;use of dog safeguarding&rdquo; with &ldquo;use of dogs for enhancing security,&rdquo; which would make it broad and cover all aspects that were not clear.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn said she was concerned that after a licence has been issued, there was no further inspection to check whether the applicant was still complying with the regulations. There should be a database which would keep a record of people who had licences so that it would be easier to check how many people needed to renew their licences.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Ramasodi said the issue around the change of &ldquo;improve&rdquo; to &ldquo;updated&rdquo; had been accepted.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Songabe said they believed that there should be some kind of synergy between the Amendment and the Principal Bill to ensure that there were no inconsistencies. Once a licence had been issued, continuous inspections would take place.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Phumelele Ngema, Parliamentary Legal Advisor, said the NLO would have to delegate some responsibility to provinces, but they would have some kind of discretion as well as to what may be delegated, hence the Bill was a Section 75. There was no contradiction between the long title and section 9 -- the Amendment Bill had referred to &lsquo;working&rsquo; animals, and in that same definition one could include animals which were used for performances and safeguarding.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr T Ramokhoase (ANC) said the Department had to remember that the Bill had to be implementable, and that would be the responsibility of the provinces. This was why the Committee was concerned about the Bill being a Section 76. Further, the Bill had to be written in such a way that the public would not be confused about what the implications were if they did not comply with the law.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Nagiah said they never dealt with any practicalities regarding a Bill, but there were consultative processes which were quite lengthy. She added that she disagreed with Ms Ngema regarding the issue of the long title and Section 9, and agreed that the Department&rsquo;s legal team would have to meet with Parliament&rsquo;s legal team.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Songabe said the Department had a budget of R55 million to carry out the services of animal welfare. Although it would be carrying out the inspections, they still had to abide by the by-laws of each municipality, so the way in which the function was carried out would differ for each city.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson said she was not happy with the summary which had been given to them by the Department on the financial implications of the Bill.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Ntombela said they planned on revising the financial implications, as well as which animals would be included in the budget.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson said Parliament&rsquo;s and the Department&rsquo;s legal advisors should at all times consult with one another, especially when there were complex issues.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Responses on the Plant Breeder&rsquo;s Rights Bill and Plant Improvement Bill</strong><br />\r\nDr Julian Jaftha, Chief Director of Plant Production and Health, said one of the responses suggested that the definition of a breeder could be simplified by referring to a natural or legal person. The DAFF thought that the presentation aimed to give examples of who may be considered a breeder, as it was usually assumed that the breeder was limited to researchers in public or private research institutions. Section 1 of the Plant Breeder&rsquo;s Rights defined a breeder sufficiently broadly to include a person who bred, discovered and developed a variety, the employer of such persons and the successor in title of the two aforementioned categories of persons. Thus the definition was sufficiently broad to cover natural and legal persons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother response to the Bills had asked whether it was possible to manipulate the period of validity of a right through operation of a will, and the DAFF response was that Section 8 of the Plant Breeder&rsquo;s Rights Bill provided for rights to be valid for periods between 20 to 30 years, depending on the particular kind of plant. A plant breeder&rsquo;s right was considered an incorporeal thing assigned to a specific breeder, which could be transferred from one individual to another. If such a transfer happened through operation of a will, the validity period did not expire and be replaced by a new period. The original period subsisted from the starting period at which it had been first assigned.<br />\r\nA plant breeder&rsquo;s right was granted in respect of the variety concerned, as opposed to the owner of the variety. This meant that the period of validity remained the same, even if the variety were to be transferred to a new owner through a will.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother response was regarding the economic importance of a plant breeder&rsquo;s right, and it had been advised that the Advisory Committee should include someone with economic expertise. The DAFF would accept this as a valid proposal, and would look into it and work with the SLA in considering it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt had been asked if the Act provided for the protection of indigenous biological resources, which were often at the risk of biopiracy. The protection of resources fell outside the scope of the Plant Breeder&rsquo;s Rights Bill or Plant Improvement Bill. However, section 16(6) of the Plant Breeder&rsquo;s Rights Bill and section 28(7) of the Plant Improvement Bill provided for compliance to any other relevant legislation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Protection, Promotion, Development and Management of Indigenous Knowledge Systems Bill, 2014, aimed among other things, to provide for the protection, promotion, development and management of indigenous knowledge systems; to provide for the management of rights of indigenous knowledge holders, and to provide for access and conditions of access to knowledge of indigenous communities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><em>Discussion</em></strong><br />\r\nMs Steyn said the Breeder&rsquo;s Rights Bill was tagged as a Section 75 Bill, but there were no details as to how this had been decided. It seemed as if the Bill should be a Section 76. Also, what were the provinces&rsquo; roles in the Bill, because she had not found any sections in the Bill which related to the provinces?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Jaftha replied that there were outlined financial implications, which amounted to R10.3 million for the Breeder&rsquo;s Rights Bill and R7 million for the Plant Improvement Bill. These costs included services provided for capacity purposes. He added that the Department had provided a detailed report for the Advisory Committee on how they should assist the Registrar, and they were in the process of trying to secure financial resources for their unfunded mandates.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Nagiah said there were concurrent functions for the national and provincial legislatures, but according to the Constitution, national legislation prevailed over any other legislation. The Bill also dealt with a Schedule 4 function, hence it was a Section 76.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson said there was a confusion regarding the Bills. The PAPA Bill was a Section 75, but the Breeder&rsquo;s Bill was a Section 76, even though the role of the provinces was more evident in the PAPA Bill.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Nagiah replied that the PAPA Bill did not fall under the concurrent functions of Schedule 4.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn said she understood the provisions in the Constitution, but the provisions in the Bill required the involvement of provinces. She asked if it was possible change the Bill to a Section 76, if the Committee did not agree with the decision.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Ngema said the first thing one should do when tagging a Bill was to look at the functions in the Schedules. In this case, agricultural matters fell under Schedule 4, which gives both the national and provincial government legislative powers to delegate on those functions. Hence the Bill was tagged Section 76.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Filtane said there were ways in which the provinces could not be involved, and one was to issue the licences only through the national department.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn again asked what the implications would be if the Bill was tagged as a Section 75, and whether it would be possible to add that the provinces would have some kind of role to play for that purpose.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Vuyokazi Ngcobozi, Parliamentary Legal Advisor, replied that one should at all times tag the Bill accordingly, and if not, the Bill became invalid.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Ngema added that one should not look at the contents of a Bill but rather at the matter of the Bill, and which of those matters were listed under the Schedules.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson said it was advisable that the Committee should rather follow the advice of the legal advisors. They did not have enough time to debate the issue because it had to be passed as an Act by June 2015.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Ntombela said there were provisions which would allow them to delegate some functions to the provinces.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson concluded that if the national department were to delegate some functions to the provinces, it would also need to provide provinces with the financial resources to carry the functions out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Briefing by DAFF on poultry issues</strong><br />\r\nMr Mooketsa Ramasodi, Chief Director of Inspection and Quarantine, DAFF, said the Agricultural Product Standards Act, 1990, regulated the sale and export of certain agricultural products through regulations, such as grading or classification according to standardised quality standards. The regulations for poultry meat prescribed that there were no clear restrictions on the treatment of poultry portions. The objectives of the poultry meat regulations were to have a greater transparency in the market place, to be able to purchase specific quality poultry meat over time and distance, to provide a platform or quality reference point from which trade within the Southern African Custom Union should be conducted, and to serve as a reference during negotiation of trade agreements between countries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany had been concerned with &lsquo;brining,&rsquo; and what it meant. Brine (salt and water) was a solution that was currently being used in conjunction with other additives, such as phosphates, gums and sweeteners. Brine was simply a water-based solution of salt and other ingredients. In terms of regulation 4(9), the chemical solution may be injected into the breast meat of a whole carcass at a maximum level of eight percent. The main objective of brine was to improve the quality of the meat by tenderisation and flavour enhancement. The revision of the poultry meat regulations stemmed from requests made from the SA Poultry Association (SAPA), the South African Revenue Service (SARS), Pick &lsquo;n Pay, the Red Meat Organisation and the Portfolio Committee, for reasons such as:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Poor quality product as a result of excessive treatment;</li>\r\n\t<li>Excessive moisture loss during thawing and cooking;</li>\r\n\t<li>Product weight gain;</li>\r\n\t<li>Financial gain;</li>\r\n\t<li>Consumer protection;</li>\r\n\t<li>Promotion of trade amongst our trading partners;</li>\r\n\t<li>Consumer awareness and various media enquiries.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The regulatory review process which had been undertaken consisted of two drafts which had been made available for public comment. There had been consultative meetings and other informal engagements. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) and Technical Barriers to Trade Agreement (TBT) had been notified of the final draft. It had been approved by the Director General, who had then addressed the comments which had been made by Members. The final step had included the Ministerial consideration and approval of the proposed amendments. The review process had started in 2010, when they had held meetings with stakeholders. The outcome of the meetings had led to a consensus on the proposed treatment level of a maximum of eight percent. DAFF had indicated that the present regulations prescribed maximum eight percent treatment levels for whole carcasses and that this should be enforced, and other issues which related to the brine treatment had also been discussed. The implications of the amendments were that treatment levels and the associated control would be affected, there would be labelling changes, the brining practice would change, there would be more meat per bag, since there would be less &lsquo;water&rsquo; in the bag, and the Department intended to revise the complete set of regulations in the near future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More comments had been received from the local community regarding the proposed levels of brine. AgriSA, the Red Meat Producers Organisation (RPO), Spif Chickens, the Association of Meat Importers and Exporters (AMIE), Rainbow Chickens and Mikon Farming were all in favour of the proposed level, but the Department of Health, SAPA and Astral Foods were against the level of eight percent and had opted for zero percent. However, Woolworths, Shoprite and Pick &lsquo;n Pay were concerned about the perceived cost increase for consumers, and whether consumers would be able to afford the products. Other major concerns were that poultry meat was price sensitive, meaning that if one producer injected slightly more than the other, their products would have an unfair market advantage, as they could sell it slightly more cheaply. Proper enforcement of regulations was currently lacking. The DAFF should thus try and consider the appointment of an assignee for poultry meat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Ramasodi concluded by saying the proposed draft amendment on brining levels represented a compromise between the industry and the consumer. The majority of the stakeholders accepted the draft amendment in its proposed state. The poultry regulations were not cast in stone and could be reviewed should the proposed amendments have an unintended negative impact. The Minister was the only person empowered to either approve or reject the proposed amendments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Ntshayisa said he was not convinced about the effectiveness of brining.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr C Maxegwana (ANC) asked what the consumers&rsquo; responses towards brining had been.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Ramokhoase asked what made DAFF think that there would be a shortage of chickens, and what was the Department doing to empower the previously disadvantaged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Z Jongbloed (DA) asked what the plan was to get consumers to become healthy if the meat remained brined. She had noticed that the Department did not have consultations with citizens for them to decide on these proposals. Why had Brazil decided not to brine their meat? Would it have any effect on South Africa, since they were both part of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa)? Why had the voted against the brining.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn also asked why the Department of Health was against brining, since the industry had confirmed that no health risks were involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Filtane said that besides the financial implications, were there problems regarding its capacity to conduct inspection which the Department faced?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Ramosadi replied that DAFF had opened up a process which would allow the public to make submissions concerning brining. The Department of Health was mostly worried about the amount of salt intake involved with brining, hence they were against the eight percent level. He requested that the Department of Health be given an opportunity to present to the Committee about why they did not agree with brining. A chicken from any production house would not have brining -- the brining happened after an animal had been slaughtered -- so the brining would not cause any industry competitiveness, and it could not be used for multiplying a product. Brazil was not the only country which did not allow brining, but the USA did not trade with South Africa due to the brining.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson said the Committee would engage further with the Department. Its role as a department was to produce food, and the Health Department&rsquo;s issue stemmed from what it was feeding South Africans. There had been cases where people had also started to brine fish as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Elaine Alexander, Deputy Director General: Economic Development and Trade and Marketing, said the African Growth and Opportunity Act of 2000 (AGOA) was originally an Act adopted by the USA to encourage industrial development, to authorise a new trade policy in Africa and to improve relations with the United States. Recently, the USA had decided that Swaziland no longer qualified to be part of AGOA because of its crimes against humanity and the lack of democracy in the country. The legislation was due to be reviewed again in 2015, and the revisions would make it easier to become eligible -- it would focus on improving the future business environment in developing African countries. Some alleged that AGOA was in contradiction with the World Trade Organisation&rsquo;s rules. South Africa was under a lot of pressure, as it had not received the go-ahead from the United States, and AGOA would be a great opportunity for South Africa for economic growth. Although the goal was to be part of AGOA, however, the Department would not compromise South Africa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Ramasodi said the most notifiable strains of Avian Influenza (AI) -- the H5 and H7 -- could be found in ostriches as well. The origin of outbreaks had been pinpointed as virus introductions from wild birds, with virus multiplication in ostriches. There had been no outbreaks of H5 or H7 in poultry other than in ostriches, and all outbreaks in ostriches were usually mild, without any pronounced signs of the disease. The history of AI had started in June 2004 in the Eastern Cape, and the outbreaks had been eradicated by culling and the disposal of all ostriches and other poultry on detected farms. After that, there had been intensive surveillance in the Western Cape, and there had been no positive serology detected in the slaughtering of birds since October 2004. In 2006 there had been a detection in the Western Cape which had been unrelated to the outbreak in 2004. The outbreak had been managed properly and by June 2006 it had been eradicated. Between 2011 and 2013, the Western Cape had seen more detections of the H5N2, which had been resolved in June 2013. No further outbreaks of High Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) had been detected again since 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Ntshayisa asked if the lack of trading between the United States and South Africa was due to the Avian Influenza.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Ramokhoase asked if the Bill was now waiting to become an Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Filtane asked if the Department had carried out any inspections in the areas and among people who had been affected with the AI. If yes, what had they found from the inspections?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Maxegwana said South Africa had done a good job in controlling the AI. Who was responsible for resourcing the management of the AI?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson asked if South Africa would be sufficiently equipped to deal with AI if another outbreak happened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Alexander said there was an opportunity for South Africa to source investment from the United States for their industries. It also opened up opportunities for scholarships and bursaries for students to study in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Ramosodi replied saying the AI outbreaks often happened during winter and the DAFF had systems in place which would help them deal with an outbreak, although they would admit that a lot of resources would be needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Consideration of minutes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Maxegwana moved the adoption of the minutes of 24 March 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Filtane seconded the motion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Ramokhoase moved the adoption of the minutes of 26 March 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Filtane seconded the motion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The minutes were adopted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The meeting was adjourned.</p>\r\n",

        "summary": "<p>The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) said all the issues which had been raised by the Committee regarding the Performing Animals Protection Amendment (PAPA) Bill had been considered by the Department&rsquo;s technical team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Concerns had been raised that the &ldquo;Objects of the Bill&rdquo; were inconsistent with the original Bill. They had therefore tried to reword the Objects of the Bill. There had also been a concern over the use of the term &ldquo;Any Animal&rdquo; which was used in the Bill, without qualifying which animals were involved. DAFF had also considered this matter and wished to clarify that the definition of an &ldquo;Animal&rdquo; remained the same definition as in the Principal Act. There was a lack of specific expertise, experience and knowledge within government to inspect a particular premise of certain animals in order to make a decision on the issuance of a licence, and DAFF was specifically concerned that there may be a shortage of skills within government when it came to wild animals</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was lengthy debate over whether the Bill was a Section 75 (National Assembly) or Section 76 (National Council of Provinces) Bill. A Member said the Department had to remember that the Bill had to be implementable, and that would be the responsibility of the provinces. This was why the Committee was concerned about the Bill being a Section 76 Bill. Members also needed a further explanation as to why the Bill should not be referred to the House of Traditional Leaders. The State Law Advisors&rsquo; opinion that the Bill was a Section 75 Bill was based on whether the Bill fell within a functional area listed in Schedule 4 of the Constitution, and the impact of the relevant provisions of the Bill had to be assessed in determining whether the Bill substantially affected the provinces. They found that it would not be necessary to refer the Bill to the National House of Traditional Leaders as the Bill did not contain provisions relating to customary law or customs of traditional communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Discussion on the Plant Breeder&rsquo;s Rights Bill and the Plant Improvement Bill dealt with issues such as the definition of a breeder, whether the period of validity of a breeder&rsquo;s rights could be manipulated through the operation of a will, and the economic importance of a plant breeder&rsquo;s right. Again, there was considerable debate over whether the Bill was a Section 75 or 76, with the Committee Chairperson saying there was a confusion regarding the Bills -- the PAPA Bill was a Section 75, but the Breeder&rsquo;s Bill was a Section 76, even though the role of the provinces was more evident in the PAPA Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The revision of poultry regulations was also discussed, with reference to brining levels. The revision stemmed from requests made from the SA Poultry Association (SAPA), South African Revenue Services, Pick &lsquo;n Pay, the Red Meat Organisation and the Portfolio Committee over concerns such as poor quality products as a result of excessive treatment, excessive moisture loss during thawing and cooking, and product weight gain. The present regulations prescribed a maximum eight percent treatment level for whole carcasses, and many stakeholders in the industry favoured this level. However, the Department of Health, SAPA and Astral Foods had opted for zero percent, and Woolworths, Shoprite and Pick &lsquo;n Pay had been concerned about the perceived cost increase for consumers, and whether they would be able to afford the products. Members wanted the Department of Health to advise the Committee why it was opposed to brining, as the industry had indicated brining had no adverse health implications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Committee was also briefed by the DAFF on the situation regarding Avian Influenza in South Africa, in the light of the African Growth and Opportunity Act of 2000 (AGOA), which had been originally adopted by the USA to encourage industrial development, to authorise a new trade policy in Africa and to improve relations with the United States. The legislation was due to be reviewed again in 2015, and the revisions would make it easier to become eligible -- it would focus on improving the future business environment in developing African countries.

        "body": "<p><strong>Protection of Performing Animals Amendment (PAPA) Bill: Legal and drafting issues</strong><br />\r\nMs Desiree Swartz, Parliamentary Legal Adviser, informed the Committee that the Constitutional Court had found that sections 2 and 3 of the Performing Animals Protection Amendment (PAPA) Bill of 2015 were inconsistent with the constitution, but it had suspended the order of invalidity for 18 months. The judgment that had been delivered on 11 January 2013 had remained valid until 10 January 2015. However, on 27 November 2014, the Constitutional Court had extended the period of suspension of the order until 12 July 2015, which was the deadline for the Amendment Bill to be passed and assented to by the President.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nClause 3 of Section 3F (1) (a) was found to be very broad. It was not clear how a National Licensing Officer would determine &ldquo;the purpose of the Act&rdquo; when there was no clause that set out the purpose. It was proposed there should be a clause in the Bill that set the purpose of the Act.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt was further proposed that Clause 3 of Section 3H (&ldquo;Application for licence&rdquo;) should be before Section 3F, which deals with the consideration and granting of applications for licences by the National Licensing Officer. It was also proposed that an amendment should be made to Section 7 in order to make provision that the Minister may prescribe fees.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith regard to Clause 4, it was proposed that the heading to this clause should also make reference to the other Acts that amended Section 11. It should read: &ldquo;Amendment of section 11 of Act 24 of 1935, as amended by Section 7 of Act 7 of 1972 and Section 9 of Act 7 of 1991&rdquo;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPertaining to Clause 5, Section 11A was to be repealed to Section 11B. It was reasoned that it was impossible to have the same section number given for a new section that dealt with &ldquo;Appeal against decision or action by the National Licensing Officer&rdquo;. It was proposed that Clause 5 of Section 11A should be broken down in more subsections, as the content of the section dealt with more than the heading to the section.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSubsection 1 of Clause 5, which dealt with making an appeal to the Minister against a decision, came under scrutiny on the basis of practicality, and it was stated it was better to appeal to the board because the Minister referred an appeal to the board and was not involved after that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLastly, she was of the view that Paragraph 11.5, bullet 3 of the Bill did not allow a delegation to officials of the provincial departments, so it was questioned if provincial officials would be involved in the administration of the Bill.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>PAPA Amendment Bill Presentation</strong><br />\r\nMr Mooketsa Ramasodi, Deputy Director-General, DAFF, said that the Department had noted the Constitutional Court judgment and had initially considered the implications and explored three options. Option 1 considered the technical amendments to the existing PAPA and focused only on sections 2 and 3. Option 2 considered a total repeal of the Act and a replacement with the new Animal Welfare Act. Option 3 considered a total repeal of the Animal Protection Act (APA) and PAPA.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Department had decided to go for Option 1, because it remedied the Constitutional Court judgment more quickly than the other options. Its implementation was adopted as it would assist Parliament to comply with the Constitutional Court judgment. In a nutshell, the Bill proposed that the functions of issuing licences, previously performed by magistrates, be delegated to the Provincial State Veterinary Office or any office of DAFF with animal scientists in the same magisterial area.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe technical amendments provide for:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>the designation of a National Licensing Officer;</li>\r\n\t<li>a procedure for the application for a license to exhibit, train or use an animal;</li>\r\n\t<li>the functions of a National Licensing Officer;</li>\r\n\t<li>the issuance of licences;</li>\r\n\t<li>the insertion of certain definitions; and</li>\r\n\t<li>an appeals process.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Clauses 1 and 2 of Sections 2 and 3 had been declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court on the basis that a member of the Judiciary should not be performing administrative actions that were supposed to be performed by the Executive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clause 3 set out a procedure for the granting and issuing of licences and matters connected with that so as to ensure compliance with the Constitutional Court judgment. This clause, amongst other things, provided for:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>the designation of a National Licensing Officer;</li>\r\n\t<li>the qualifications and functions of the National Licensing Officer;</li>\r\n\t<li>the appointment of experts to assist the National Licensing Officer;</li>\r\n\t<li>the delegation of powers and functions by the National Licensing Officer; and</li>\r\n\t<li>the procedure for the consideration and granting of applications for licensing.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Clause 4 dealt with the amendment of Section 11. This clause sought to incorporate additional definitions into the Act that were consequential to the revised procedure adopted for the granting and issuing of licences. The following definitions had been inserted: &ldquo;Animal Scientist&rdquo;, &ldquo;Officer&rdquo;, &ldquo;National Licensing Officer&rdquo; and &ldquo;Veterinarian&rdquo;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nClause 5 provided for an appeal process by the insertion of section 11A, which provides for the establishment of an ad hoc appeal board by the Minister, the appointment of members, and appointment of the chairperson and functions of the chairperson and the board.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nClause 6 provided that the short title of this Act, upon its enactment, should be the Performing Animals Protection Amendment Act of 2014, and this would come into operation on a date fixed by the proclamation in the Gazette.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nParallel to this, Mr Ramasodi said a holistic Animal Welfare Strategic Framework had been drafted in response to the short-term and long-term animal welfare matters, and was currently undergoing formal Departmental approval processes. A comprehensive &ldquo;modern&rdquo; Animal Welfare Bill was envisaged and it would repeal and substitute all old Animal Welfare laws.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn view of the time constraints, the Department had also successfully approached the Constitutional Court to request an extension up to 12 July 2015. DAFF continued to interact with stakeholders on PAPA, and a media statement had been issued. Radio and television material was in the production phase. The draft bill had been published in the Gazette for public comment on 19 April 2014 and written comments had been received from various stakeholders, such as the Humane Education Trust, the Dog Club, Love South African Circus, the Animal Anti-Cruelty League, the SA Dog Academy and the South African Federation of Sledding Sports.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA stakeholder consultative workshop had been held on 16 May 2014 and was attended by representatives of various stakeholders, including the DAFF, Animal Action, the film industry, Wet Nose, Boswell&rsquo;s Circus, Linda Security, McLaren&rsquo;s Circus and the Commercial Producers&rsquo; Association.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally, looking at the financial implications, DAFF and its provincial departments would in the short-term reprioritize the existing resources in order to accommodate the new functions. The departments would be encouraged to utilize existing state veterinarians and animal scientists in different municipal districts. However, the future years would have to cater for the new component on Animal Welfare, and an estimated budget of R54m had been envisaged to carry the operations and the structure of the National Licensing Officer; technical staff; and administrative staff.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Plant Improvement Bill Presentation</strong><br />\r\nMs Noluthando Netnou-Nkoane, Director of Genetic Resources, DAFF, told the Committee the purpose of plant improvement legislation was to regulate the quality of plants and propagation material intended for cultivation and sale by means of the registration of types of businesses and premises involved in this field. It would also cover the national listing of plant varieties, the import and export control of plants and propagation material, and improvement schemes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the development of the Plant Improvement Bill, experiences and constraints in the implementation of the Plant Improvement Act of 1976 had been considered, including other relevant national legislation, strategies and policies. The Bill recognised the importance of quality propagating material to support sustainable agricultural production and the important contribution of the seed trade to the economy. It also recognised the important role of quality standards for plants and seeds, as well as the standards for the types of businesses dealing with plants and seeds, towards food security.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt the time it was being developed, consultation and national workshops were carried out with key stakeholders. A notice had been published in the Government Gazette for public comments. Talks had been held with the affected Departments of Science and Technology, Trade and Industry and Environmental Affairs, including the National House of Traditional Leaders. The inputs had been incorporated and the draft Bill had been finalised. The State Law Advisors had made comments on the Bill, and it was not in conflict with the Constitution and other government legislation. The final Bill had been certified by the State Law Advisors.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause the current Act dated from 1976, it had been found it did not cater for recent developments. Its penalties and enforcement procedures were not effective. The structure of the current Act was too cumbersome and difficult to read, and it posed difficulty in facilitating the participation of small-holder farmers in current certification schemes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSection 2 of Chapter 1 dealt with types of crops covered and how to extend to more crops. Sections 3-8 of Chapter 2 looked at the designation and functions of the Registrar, discretionary powers, registers and inspection of documents. Sections 9-21 of Chapter 3 dealt with the types of businesses requiring registration, application and registration procedure, requirements and termination. Sections 22-23 of Chapter 4 looked at the requirements for plants and propagating material and exemptions for certain plants and propagating material.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSections 24-26 of Chapter 5 looked at the content, maintenance and publication of the National Varietal List and the removal of varieties. Sections 27-32 of Chapter 6 were about varieties eligible for listing, and the procedure for application, documentation and objection. Sections 33-34 of Chapter 7 dealt with the requirements for denominations. Sections 35-37 of Chapter 8 looked at requirements for testing and decision-making and evaluation for distinctness, uniformity and stability (DUS).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSection 38 of Chapter 9 looked at optional evaluation for cultivation and use. Section 39 of Chapter 10 was about the procedure for hearings by the Registrar. Section 40 of Chapter 11 covered the National Varietal List Journal and its content. Sections 41-42 of Chapter 12 covered procedures for inspections and inspection on grounds of warrant, while Sections 43-44 looked at the requirements and procedures for the importing and exporting of plants and propagating material.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSections 45-46 of Chapter 14 looked at the types of schemes and procedures to establish. Section 47 of Chapter 15 dealt with the procedure for appeals against decisions by the Registrar or authority of a scheme. Sections 48-51 of Chapter 16 were about the purpose, composition and procedures of the Advisory Committee. Sections 52-63 of Chapter 17 looked at the request for tests by other authorities, disclosure of information, regulations, offences and penalties, evidence, liability, delegations and repeal of laws.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn implementing the Bill, the National Authority for performing tests for variety listing was in place and it included two evaluation farms in Roodeplaat and Stellenbosch. The Official Seed Testing Station, which was internationally accredited by the International Seed Testing Association, was also in place at Roodeplaat. The appointment of an Advisory Body would follow the process of calling for nominations and appointment by the Minister. The systems for registration of premises and national inspection services were also in place for enforcement.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Plant Breeders&rsquo; Rights Bill</strong><br />\r\nMr Thabo Ramashala, Director of Plant Production, DAFF, informed the Members that plant breeders&rsquo; rights in South Africa were protected under the Plant Breeders&rsquo; Rights Act of 1976. The Act provided for the requirements for the grant, the scope of protection of plant breeders&rsquo; rights, the granting of licences and other matters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen the Bill was drafted, consultation with stakeholders had been carried out and national and provincial workshops had been conducted in the Eastern Cape, Free State, Limpopo and Western Cape. The state law advisors had made inputs to the Bill and pre-certified it. The Competition Commission, Economic Cluster and Economic Cabinet Committee had also forwarded inputs in 2014. The Bill received a certificate in February 2015.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Plant Breeders&rsquo; Bill, when it was developed, had taken into account the principal legislation, the Plant Breeders&rsquo; Rights Act of 1976, and the experiences and constraints in the implementation of the Act and available options to protect intellectual property rights concerning plant varieties. It had also considered relevant international obligations and other relevant national legislation, policies and strategies and programmes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Bill recognises the importance of new plant varieties to support sustainable agricultural production, the important role of breeders in developing new plant varieties and the importance of an effective plant variety protection system. It further acknowledges the considerable investments needed to develop a new variety, the need to provide incentives for breeders of new plant varieties and the importance of balancing the needs of farmers and breeders.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSection 1 of the Bill defined the breeder as:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>the person who bred, or discovered and developed, the variety;</li>\r\n\t<li>the employer of the person contemplated in paragraph (a), if that person was an employee whose duties were such that the variety was bred, or discovered and developed, in the performance of those duties;</li>\r\n\t<li>the successor in title of the person contemplated in paragraph (a), or the successor in title of the employer contemplated in paragraph (b).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Sections 2-6 of Chapter 1 looked at the designations and functions of the Registrar and the Register of the Plant Breeders&rsquo; Rights. Sections 7-9 of Chapter 2 dealt with the protection given to the holder of plant breeders&rsquo; rights, the duration of the plant breeders&rsquo; rights, and the period of sole rights and exceptions to plant breeders&rsquo; rights. Exceptions to the scope of the plant breeders&rsquo; rights were around breeding other varieties, acts done for experimental purposes, acts done privately and for non- commercial purposes and farm-saved seed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSections 11-14 of Chapter 2 were about the exhaustion of plant breeders&rsquo; rights, joint holders of plant breeders&rsquo; rights, transfer of plant breeders&rsquo; rights and the State being bound by plant breeders&rsquo; rights. Chapter 3 dealt with the varieties in respect of which plant breeders&rsquo; rights may be granted. It may be granted in respect of any variety of all plant genera and species, excluding fungi and algae, if it was new, distinct, uniform and stable and had an acceptable variety denomination.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSections 15-22 of Chapter 3 looked at the application for the grant of a plant breeder&rsquo;s right, priority and redating of applications, provisional protection, rejection of application, acceptance and registration of application, amendment of application and objection to application for the grant of a plant breeder&rsquo;s right. Sections 23-25 of Chapter 4 dealt with the denomination of variety, amendment of denomination and marking of labels and containers. Sections 26-28 of Chapter 5 scrutinised the examination of variety and grant of plant breeders&rsquo; rights.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChapter 6 covered the hearing of objections. Sections 30-31 of Chapter 7 looked at the payment of annual fees and maintenance of propagating material. Sections 32-33 of Chapter 8 dealt with the infringement of plant breeders&rsquo; rights and remedies in respect of infringement of plant breeders&rsquo; rights. Chapter 9 covered licences &ndash; the hearing of applications for and issuance of compulsory licences.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSections 37-39 of Chapter 10 considered the expiry of plant breeders&rsquo; rights, the cancellation of plant breeders&rsquo; rights and voluntary surrender of plant breeders&rsquo; rights. Chapter 11 was about the enforcement of plant breeders&rsquo; rights, while Chapter 12 dealt with appeals against decisions or actions by the Registrar. Sections 42-45 of Chapter 13 considered the establishment of an Advisory Committee, the appointment of its members and termination of membership, disclosure of interests by members and meetings of the Committee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSections 46-58 of Chapter 14 dealt with general provisions like offences and penalties, correction of errors, repeal of amendments, jurisdiction of magistrate courts, prohibition of trafficking by officers, disclosure of information, entering of premises for inspection, regulations and delegation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Ramashala concluded by saying the National Authority to manage the Plant Breeders&rsquo; Rights systems was in place, and included two evaluation farms situated at Roodeplaat and Stellenbosch. The appointment of an Advisory Body would follow the process of calling for nominations and appointment by the Minister, and an awareness programme on the Plant Breeders&rsquo; Rights would be developed during the 2015/16 period.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Discussion</em><br />\r\nLegal and drafting issues identified in the Protection of Performing Animals Bill were first up for discussion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs D Carter (COPE) wanted to know the definition of &lsquo;any animal&rsquo; as stated in the Bill.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Phumelele Ngema, Parliamentary Legal Advisor, explained that the definition of animal was covered by the Animals Protection Act 71 of 1962 and meant any equine, bovine, sheep, goat, pig, fowl, ostrich, dog, cat or other domestic animal or bird or any wild animal, wild bird or reptile, which was in captivity or under control of any person.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs A Steyn (DA) asked for clarity regarding the tagging of the Bill.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Ngema said the Performing Animals Protection Amendment Bill had been tagged as a Section 75 Bill by the Joint Tagging Committee. She said it was a very complex matter to tag a Bill, especially where the subject of the Bill did not fall squarely in a functional area that was listed in schedule 4 or 5 of the Constitution.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nShe said there were a few functional areas which they considered could be involved in the content of the Bill. These included the consideration of &ldquo;animal control and diseases,&rdquo; which was a schedule 4 concurrent functional area. Considering the definition of &ldquo;animal&rdquo;, one could also argue that under schedule 5, few functional areas called for one to apply one&rsquo;s mind to the &ldquo;licensing of dogs&rdquo; facilities for the accommodation, care and burial of animals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne Member of the Committee suggested the Bill should be referred to the National House of Traditional Leaders, because some rural communities made use of wild animals for their traditional activities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Ngema informed the Committee the referral of the Bill to the National House of Traditional Leaders in terms of Section 18 of the Traditional Leadership and Governance Framework Act 41 of 2003 was not applicable because the content of the Bill did not contain provisions that pertained to customary law, indigenous law or customs of traditional communities, or did not regulate nor seek to alter the traditional customs or customary law.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr B Thomas (ANC) proposed an extension of time for consultation before the court could proceed with its work in terms of finalising the Bill, because he felt consultation with traditional leaders was still needed. They were going to be affected by the legislation, irrespective of what the law said, because the majority of animals were in rural areas.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Carter referred to the DAFF presentation, and asked how the Department was going to finance PAPA with a budget of R54m, in the light of the budget cuts the Department had experienced, because it appeared that some of the problems raised last year in September had not been resolved.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProfessor Edith Vries, Director-General: DAFF, explained the Department was dealing with the ruling of the Constitutional Court, whether it had a budget or not. The Department had made financial projections and she indicated this branch of DAFF generated R120m per annum. The Constitutional Court had made sure Parliament would get the law enacted, and DAFF had explained to the Constitutional Court about the cause for the delays.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn intervened, saying it was the Department that had been delaying matters because it had been informed immediately after September last year, but had failed to report to the Committee by November 2014. It was not the Committee that had been delaying the process.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Carter commented that the Department was arrogant and not willing to listen to the Committee, and that was why it was failing to do its work.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr M Filtane (UDM) asked if the issuance of a notice regarding consultations in the Government Gazette was sufficient. He then wanted to establish if there were not minimal limitations with security companies in terms of regulating the issuance of licences.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Tembile Songabe , Vetrinary Public Health, DAFF, said the consultation was not enough and that was why they were making use of radio and TV advertisements. Concerning security companies, he said there were few who had responded and they were thinking of starting road shows.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn asked for clarity on the delays for the passing of the Amendment Bill.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Ramasodi stated that the Bill had to go through the economic sector infrastructure development unit, outside of the Department, and had now been approved by the economic sector infrastructure DG Cluster.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Filtane suggested that the Department should go back and act on the concerns of the Committee and those of the stakeholders in putting the law together, and should report back to the Committee before 21 April 2014.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Plant Improvement Bill</strong><br />\r\nMr Filtane referred to the variety of persons classified as breeders, and suggested the use of the words &ldquo;legal persona&rdquo; if the intention was to incorporate everyone instead of listing different types of breeders, as this could unintentionally exclude other people even though they might meet the requirements. Further, he wanted to know what determined the termination of the plant breeders&rsquo; rights. He enquired if medicinal plants were covered in the Bill.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Netnou-Nkoane, referring to the variety of persons, said the definition was going to be left that way so that it could be understood by everyone. On the termination of rights, she said the protection was on the variety itself, not on the owner. Concerning medicinal plants, she explained that they checked if one complied with the Biodiversity Act and Indigenous Knowledge Systems Act. One had to provide proof of the application and show that the process had been followed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Carter wanted to establish if the Department was starting to modify products, and where genetically modified organisms (GMOs) were fitting into the process.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Netnou-Nkoane stated that DUS standards were equally applied to GMO crops, and none of the fruits and vegetables produced in South Africa were genetically modified. Only 85% of maize, 99% of cotton and 95% of soya were genetically modified.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Adoption of minutes</strong><br />\r\n<em>Minutes of 10 March 2015 </em><br />\r\nThe Chairperson took the Members through the document, page by page, and said the document reflected the concerns raised and resolutions taken by the Committee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn proposed acceptance of the minutes. Mr P Mabe (ANC) seconded.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Minutes of 13 March 2015 </em><br />\r\nThe Chairperson took the Members through the document, page by page. The Chairperson said the document reflected the concerns raised and resolutions taken by the Committee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Mabe stated the resolutions did not say anything about the invitation sent to the Trust to come and make a presentation to the Committee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Filtane commented that no responses from Members were reflected in the minutes. It was only the concerns and questions that were reflected.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn proposed for the acceptance of the minutes. Mr Filtane seconded.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Minutes of 17 March 2015 </em><br />\r\nThe Chairperson took the Members through the document, page by page. The Chairperson said the document reflected the concerns raised and resolutions taken by the Committee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn proposed acceptance of the minutes. The Chairperson seconded.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe meeting was adjourned.</p>\r\n",

They asked how the Department was going to finance PAPA with a budget of R54m in light of the budget cuts the Department had experienced because it appeared that some of the problems raised in September last year had not been resolved. They wanted to know if the issuance of a notice regarding consultations in the Government Gazette was sufficient, and asked for clarity on the cause of delays in the passing of the Amendment Bill. It was suggested that the Department should go back and act on the concerns of the Committee and those of the stakeholders in putting the law together and should report back to the Committee before 21 April 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding the Plant Improvement Bill, Members suggested the use of the words &ldquo;legal persona&rdquo; if the intention was to incorporate everyone instead of listing different types of breeders, as this could unintentionally exclude other people, even though they might meet the requirements. They wanted to know what determined the termination of the plant breeders&rsquo; rights and enquired if medicinal plants were covered in the Bill. They questioned whether the Department was starting to modify products, and where genetically modified organisms (GMOs) fitted into the process.</p>\r\n",

        "body": "<p><strong>Onderstepoort Biological Products (OBP) briefing</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Steven Cornelius, Chief Executive Officer, Onderstepoort Biological Products (OBP), took the Committee through the five strategic goals to illustrate what the organisation has done so far and what it plans to achieve during this MTEF period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strategic Goal 1 was to attain a high performance organisation underpinned by appropriate structures, institutional stability, high performance products, shared values and financial stability. He said that the new organisational structure aligned to strategy has been approved and implemented. The turnover rate of staff is to be maintained between 4% and 12% and the plan is to develop and approve a Succession Planning policy and a retention strategy. The Performance Management System and policy is still to be reviewed in order to be aligned to market trends. The annual sales revenue has increased by 8%, nationally and internationally, against a target of R97 million. The total value of sales to provinces is estimated to increase to R2 million by 2017/18, against a target of R1 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 3% annual increase on the number of doses sold to the export market has been recorded. The rate of intermediary and final batch failures has been reduced: virology by 10%, bacterial by 5% and water for injection by 5%. The monthly overall equipment effectiveness to optimum level per machine has increased, against the 75% equipment capacity targeted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The entity wanted to conduct two internal audits annually and maintain ISO accreditation. In terms of upgrading current facilities, 70% of the layout changes have been implemented. All identified equipment has been procured. With regard to the new facility for the Goods Manufacturing Processes to be constructed by 2017/18, Phase 1 is 100% completed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strategic Goal 2 was to improve relations with stakeholders through the use of effective stakeholder relations management and communication strategies. Dr Cornelius said the OBP wants to see an increase in client and stakeholder satisfaction by 2017/18. The marketing strategy has been approved, but it still needs to be implemented. The Customer Relations Management strategy would be developed and implemented. In terms of improving communication levels and brand awareness, the communication strategy has been developed and implemented. The stakeholder management plan has been developed and implemented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strategic Goal 3 was to grow OBP into a sustainable organisation, with sufficient levels of profitability. Here, Dr Cornelius noted that two new international markets are being developed every year, and the target was to retain that. Five lost markets had been recaptured. In terms of the number of doses sold, the annual sales volume has increased by 3%. The distribution strategy and its implementation plan have been approved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strategic Goal 4 was to improve efficiency of production processes and introduce new products in line with technology and market trends. OBP had submitted two new product dossiers to the Registrar, and amended dossiers on production processes had been submitted to the Registrar, exceeding the target of submitting one. There is no target for dossiers based on new generation technologies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strategic Goal 5 was to contribute and support emerging farmers, food security and economic growth through government programmes. Dr Cornelius said that during this MTEF period, the OBP plans to support three projects that assist the market of smallholders and emerging farmers. It plans to facilitate 22 training sessions or events with smallholder farmers and technicians every year, and to support two agricultural co-operatives (as defined by the Department of Trade and Industry) in rural areas. The OBP wants to see an increase in the supply of vaccines to smallholder farmers by a number of doses annually. The target for this period is 1 500 doses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Graphs and tables were shown to illustrate financial overview, approved budget, capital expenditure, and income and balance statements over the MTEF period - see attached presentation for full details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Discussion</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson commented there is a concern from stakeholders the entity is losing staff and that furthermore the CEO might be leaving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Cornelius reassured the Committee the staff complement had grown from 180 to 192, and the Minister had extended his term by three more years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr T Ramokhoase (ANC), firstly asked how the five lost markets were going to be recaptured. Secondly, he wanted to establish if the entity had a programme to train emerging farmers. Thirdly, he enquired if the there was a strategy on learnership and internship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Cornelius responded firstly that there was a sub-contracted service provider who had given the entity information on major role players and competitors, including their products. The OBP has already done a SWOT analysis that would help it to recapture those markets. In relation to the emerging farmers, he said that was done with the help of provinces, and that OBP had capacity to help teach extension officers to use vaccines, and it was trying to secure funding in order to work with the Sector Education and Training Authorities (SETAs). In relation to learnerships and internship, the OBP had 19 candidates on its internship programme, who were being paid a stipend and were to be absorbed into the system on completion of their internship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr M Filtane (UDM) wanted to find out about the status of the 2014 agreement that the OBP had signed with DAFF, and asked about the percentage of SA livestock that were assisted with vaccines. He also enquired if OBP had done any marketing research about recapturing lost markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Mono Mashaba, Director: OBP, replied that on the 2014 agreement, OBP had tried to negotiate with DAFF. on the issue of R50 million that the Department had promised. Nothing came out of that, but now the National Treasury has stepped in to assist. In relation to the livestock, he elaborated that OBP was using statistics that told the organisation about the owners who used the vaccines, where they bought them and which companies were selling specific vaccines. The statistics then informed the OBP&#39;s strategies on what it planned to do in the market. A study and market research had been commissioned. It was looking at SADC, Asia and Europe, and would give an indication of markets to be penetrated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms A Steyn (DA) asked that OBP should comment on its audit outcome and the R110 million allocated to it. She wanted to know how the upgrades were going to be done, and equipment maintained, if there was a decrease in the budget, although she did note that the OBP was planning to increase sales. She asked if the OBP was aware that the private sector was doing research to develop its own vaccines. She wondered if the OBP was still justified in being a state-owned entity and doing primary health care for animals or if it needed rather to participate in an open-free market on its own, without state help, because the state funds were giving it an unfair added advantage. Finally, she enquired if the quality of the vaccines and non-availability of vaccines had discouraging provinces from buying from OBP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Cornelius firstly responded to the matter of the budget cuts and audit outcomes. He believed that the targets that OBP had set were achievable, and further noted that it had been austere when incurring expenses, and was trying to reach a good balance between the costs and the product quality. In relation to the upgrades and equipment maintenance, he enlightened the Committee that Phase 1 dealt with the upgrades of existing facilities, and Phase 2 was about buying new facilities. The new facilities were not going to affect the existing facilities, and the existing facilities were not going to have a bearing on the operations that the old facilities had done before. In relation to equipment maintenance, the entity had put out a tender that stipulated that all new equipment must come with a maintenance plan, so that maintenance could be done internally. However, if it be could not be fixed internally, the supplier would have to come and attend to that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Cornelius stated that the private sector was of course at liberty to do research because it was operating in a free market economy. Even though that was the case, the Department of Trade and Industry (dti) had discovered that OBP remained the biggest exporter of vaccines. In relation to the question whether the entity should remain state-owned or private, he said that this was something that related to policy and therefore would have to be discussed with the DAFF and National Treasury. The Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries was addressing the fact that provinces were not buying from OBP. He qualified that this was not because the product was poor, but because of the tender process that had to be followed. There were vaccines that had been donated to provinces who had a Memorandum of Understanding with OBP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr C Maxegwana (ANC) commented that it was positive to see the entity talking about brand awareness because it is was largely unknown and far more needed to be done to promote it. He asked how the OBP was going about identifying agricultural cooperatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Cornelius said the OBP was making use of the systems of DAFF and its provincial offices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Z Jongbloed (DA) wanted to know if OBP was experiencing fraud problems or whether, by incorporating a Fraud Prevention Plan in its corporate plans, it was merely being proactive. She also asked the entity to comment on its internal audit capacity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Cornelius stated the entity was being proactive and was trying to comply with National Treasury requirements. No fraud cases had been reported yet. He reported that the internal audit capacity was good and that a service provider had been appointed to work with the audit committee, and had produced an audit plan already.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn wanted to find out if OBP was working on a plan to participate and grow the small animals sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Cornelius made it clear the entity was focusing on what it was currently doing, not going into the territory of developing vaccines for small animals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson asked for clarity on plans and time lines for attaining Goods Manufacturing Processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Cornelius explained that Phase 1 was 80% completed. A technical team had been appointed to look at Environmental Impact Assessments, and by 2018, it was hoped that the new structure would be completed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr P Mabe (ANC) wanted to know if OBP was able to address infrastructure challenges, seeing that it was self-sustainable and was not relying solely on state funds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Mashaba elaborated that OBP was being reshaped. There had been some problems in the production line since last year. Some of the weak areas had been identified and these were a result of the ageing infrastructure. Another challenge over the past two years had been getting the product out and distributed. Scientists were now working on the problem and there was protocol to be followed. New technologies had replaced manual labour. It was an on-going process but there were systems in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>South African Veterinary Council (SAVC) briefing</strong><br />\r\nDr Jana Pretorius, Vice President: SA Veterinary Council, highlighted some concerns that hampered the workings of the Council (or SAVC). These revolve around divisions within the profession, budgetary constraints and legislative issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On lack of unity within the profession, she indicated that the Joint Public Relations Committee and Heritage Committee would be revived to promote and unify the veterinary professions, in which all veterinary stakeholders should be involved. The IT Transformation plan was going to be implemented to ensure effective service to the veterinary professions and improved communication with all stakeholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She stated that budgetary constraints were always a consideration. The goal of the Council was to mobilise resources. This would help create an effective administration and to find the balance between operations and strategy, and improve human resources. She mentioned that in the whole country, the profession had only 5 845 practitioners (including veterinarians and veterinary specialists and Veterinary Para-Professionals like veterinary nurses, laboratory animal technologists, veterinary technologists, animal health technicians and authorised persons).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In regard to the legislation, she reported that the SAVC did not currently have enough powers to make interventions and oversee some of the problems besetting the profession and industry. The Threatened and Protected Species (TOPS) regulations published by the Minister of Environmental Affairs prevented veterinarians from doing their work. It took months to acquire permits, and a further concern was that the permit requirements were applied differently in provinces. It was the opinion of the SAVC that the Minister of Environmental Affairs had acted outside her powers in imposing the requirement on veterinarians to obtain permits, in addition to registration with the SAVC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was also a court case pending between the Wildlife Ranching SA (WRSA) and the Department of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF), the SAVC and the Medicines Control Council (MCC). The SAVC had amended its Rule 10 for veterinarians, to ensure veterinarians were the end-users of highly scheduled medicines for chemical immobilisation of wild animals. Anaesthesia was a veterinary procedure. The WRSA, however, was of the opinion that these highly scheduled medicines should be available also to game farmers. The case was still ongoing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were also problems pertaining to the two Acts regulating medicines, the Medicines and Related Substances Act, No 101 of 1965 and the Fertilisers, Farm Feeds, Agricultural Remedies and Stock Remedies Act No 36 of 1947. The lack of control of veterinary medicines and stock remedies posed serious risk for food safety and security. The Amendment Act 16 of 2012 had not yet been enacted and<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGraphs and tables were shown to illustrate performance indicators and MTEF budget allocation, see attached documentation for full details.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em><strong>Discussion</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr S Mncwabe (NFP) asked if the entity had a strategy to recruit young people to the profession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Pretorius said the SA Veterinary Council was very involved at grassroots level. Liaison happened with the institutions of higher learning. The SAVC had met with various stakeholders and it was agreed to advertise the profession in the national media. As a way of recruiting young people, especially in rural areas, there had been a reality show that was done around the Kruger National Park.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Ramokhoase wanted some clarity on the divisions in the veterinary professions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Pretorius explained that the main problem lay around state veterinary services. The SAVC would like to intervene to try to resolve them. He cited that, for example, services of veterinarians were most needed in areas like Eastern Cape, but here the reality was that the state veterinary services were poor. It had come to the attention of SAVC that the travelling allowances paid to veterinary officers were equal to those paid to librarians. That explained why some farmers preferred to use private veterinary services, simply because they were disillusioned with state services. This issue was supposed to be taken up by DAFF, but there is too much bureaucracy and no real monitoring of state veterinary services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn wanted to know where the income of the entity was derived, and asked if the entity had had any meetings with the Minister. She further wanted clarity on the issue of people from overseas who would apply to come to do veterinary work in South Africa. She asked the meaning of &quot;authorised persons&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Pretorius reported that the SAVC&#39;s income came from the annual maintenance fees of the registered members. The entity was self&ndash;funded. She further said the Council had had two meetings with the Minister and a lot of good has come out of that. If anyone from overseas wanted to come and do veterinary work in this country, they would have to comply with the requirements, and write exams. There was a minimum requirement to be met in order to do the practical examination. Some of them were not accepted because the SAVC had to adhere to the standards of the local universities and the SAVC had to ratify their results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Pretorius explained that &quot;authorised persons&quot; referred to people who did not have the full qualifications of veterinarians. They worked under a qualified veterinarian and wrote exams after they had done their time. They were under the supervision of a veterinarian and their work was regulated. This also served as an empowerment exercise, especially in rural areas, to help those who had got the talent but had no resources to study further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Filtane wanted to find out the real problem regarding the introduction of compulsory veterinary community service. He also wanted to know what the problem was regarding the enactment of the two Acts regulating medicines. Lastly, he wanted to establish what the contentious issue was with Act 36 of 1947, and how it discourages farmers from adhering to rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Pretorius noted that the problem with the introduction of the compulsory veterinary community service, was that the regulations had not yet been finalised, and there were concerns that the necessary resources would not be available. The service could not be introduced until the regulations were passed. Another concern related to inefficiencies and the line of command in state veterinary services. The main concern and problem around enacting the two pieces of legislation was that there was confusion on the control of medicines, and particularly who was to regulate what.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main contentious issue with Act 36 of 1947 had to do with the fact that anti-microbial resistance could result from sales of antibiotics that were registered under that Act, if they were simply allowed to be sold from any outlet, and without a script. The seller would not always inform the farmer of the withdrawal periods, and this ended up resulting in medicines still being prevalent in food products that were consumed by the public. The SAVC had a Food Safety and Security Committee (FSSC) that dealt with food safety concerns. In addition to this, the Registrar responsible for administering that Act had been requested to put better controls in place for the distribution of anti-biotics. The FSSC met with the two Registrars, for the two acts, and discussed the possibility of transferring the anti-biotics sections from Act 36 (Fertilisers, Foods Act) to Act 101 (Medicines and Related Substances Act) so that there could be control of the use of the anti-microbials. In addition, she said that vaccination was the main intervention to ensure the health of animals. When critical vaccines were not available, or were not administered at the right time, the national herd would be compromised. Producers exploited both the lack of vaccines and the current loopholes in the legislation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr John Adam, Councillor, SAVC, added that the major concern of the SAVC was to ensure food security. Vaccines were the solution to food security, but if they were not available, then there was simply nothing more that could be done. In the process, through lack of vaccination, the markets would also be lost. He hoped this would be addressed soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson informed the meeting that there had been a meeting anticipated for the Ministers of DAFF and Environmental Affairs, to discuss some of the matters related to SAVC, but it appeared they had not met.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Agricultural Research Council (ARC) briefing</strong><br />\r\nDr Shadrack Moephuli, Chief Executive Officer, ARC, focused his presentation mainly on pressing human resources issues, information technology and infrastructure management of the entity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With regard to human resources, he indicated that the main risks were around the recruitment of high-level qualified and experienced personnel, succession planning; and the loss of high-level qualified and experienced personnel. A high proportion of experienced researchers in the ARC were approaching retirement, and higher-end specialist skills to ensure the future growth of the ARC were not being provided by the conventional educational streams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He pointed out there was a need for a higher ratio of scientists to total staff, particularly at post-graduate level. There was a need to improve the qualifications profile of the ARC and to expand its base and focus on Masters and PhD candidates. In addition, there was also an urgent requirement to address and improve the ratios of women, black and young researchers. Finally, the ARC must develop research capacity in emerging national priority science areas like nanotechnology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He expanded by saying that on the current projections, 8.6% of the total workforce was due to retire during the next five years. Of the 207 employees, 52 employees were from the scientific capacity: 9 research team managers, 18 researchers and specialist researchers, 4 senior managers (core), and 21 technicians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ARC was working on creating an enabling environment for optimal use of information communication and technology (ICT) resources to support the ARC business initiatives. This could be achieved through innovations to support information dissemination initiatives, increased mobility and use of mobile applications, improved access to information resources for all employees, and improved ICT resources to enable research and development through informatics. The ARC aimed to provide a Knowledge Management Platform to enhance its research and development initiatives and service delivery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He then spoke to the infrastructure management needs. ARC needed to find optimal use of ARC land and assets, buildings and equipment for research and development, and particularly to find best use for land. It should also dispose of non-strategic assets; and improve the generation of income. The ARC was attempting to build strong partnerships and collaborations with interested third parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Moephuli emphasised that the budget cuts were going to have serious implications. Already, there was a 20% cut in Parliamentary grants. It had been agreed that ARC would raise salaries by 8%, and it was projected that the electricity costs would increase by 12.7%. The budget cuts were going to hamper the rural development projects on which the ARC was currently working, and there would be no funding for Economic Competitiveness Packages. Furthermore, the organisation was not going to be able to fill critical vacancies and fund multi-year projects. This would also affect the vaccine development projects, and marketing activities and student intake would be limited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, Dr Moephuli reported on some of the achievements of the ARC. It had managed to develop and implement a sustainable funding model and implement the disease priority matrix. It had designed and implemented a standardised quality management system for laboratories providing services. It had managed to develop a detailed multi-year implementation plan to respond to the recommendations of the ARC External Performance and Management Review. It was implementing the project of Centres of Collaboration with universities and other learning Institutions</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Graphs and tables were shown to illustrate performance indicators and MTEF budget allocation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Discussion</strong></em><br />\r\nThe Chairperson remarked that the ARC had been subjected to a budget cut because the National Treasury found that the entity had a surplus, but the Minister had indicated that it was already committed to achieving certain goals, and so the Minister and the National Treasury were due to have a meeting around budget cuts affecting the agricultural sector. She noted the Department had not &quot;sold&quot; its product very well, and that was why its budget had been cut. Furthermore, there was an ongoing review of all the Department&#39;s entities. These entities should learn to complement each other and not compete, and its executives should refrain from paying themselves huge salaries. When the National Treasury looked at the budget, the issues that the Committee, Auditor-General and Minister of Finance had raised had all been included and that ultimately affected the overall budget.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn relation to the ARC specifically, the Chairperson wanted to know if there were plans in place to replace the retiring researchers. She commented that the ARC had not mentioned the Agricultural Policy Action Plan (APAP) in its presentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Moephuli indicated that an institutional review was being done and the results would come out the end of May. The Minister did indicate to the entity the concerns about budget cuts. The &quot;technocrats&quot; were merely doing their work but it was important to know and understand the impact of that work. The surplus, was income received for work that was targeted to be done, and that was reflected as 2014/15 income, not 2015/16.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Moephuli confirmed that there were plans to replace those individuals who would be retiring, but the replacements would not be senior people, but juniors, and that meant that the work of the ARC might regress for a while, although it was concentrating on paying them decent salaries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe clarified that there was no specific mention of the APAP in its presentation, but that the work of ARC was not separate from APAP, indeed it contributed to the whole APAP programme, and a specific strategy on how it must do so had been drawn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Mabe commented that the ARC had to start looking at areas of collaboration, because the issues it was raising were similar to those raised by OBP and SAVC. He asked why the entity had got a property aspect in its strategy, if its core business is agriculture. Also, he wanted to find out if the introduction of the mobile forms of communication was going to enable the ARC to help small farmers in rural areas to sell their products to markets. Lastly, he asked if the ARC has considered producing its own scholastic journal in order to generate income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Moephuli commented on collaboration by highlighting that the OBP manufactured vaccines whilst the ARC did innovative and development work on vaccines. This was the point of difference, and he indicated the OBP had not developed any vaccine itself, over the past twenty years. The ARC worked with other institutions of higher learning, like Fort Hare University, in the training of extension officers. In relation to the question on property, he clarified that the ARC had got properties on its name, and thus was responsible for the maintenance of those properties. Freeways cut through some of these properties and others were declared heritage sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In relation to the mobile applications, he stated that any IT systems to be developed had to be user-friendly so that the farmer could take a picture of the product and SMS it to the ARC, in order that the latter then provide assistance with the market. The languages used in these mobile applications included Afrikaans, SeSotho, isiZulu and some English for grain farmers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He noted the suggestion on the scholastic journal, and he reported the ARC already had a journal that it produced but the income it derived from that was not substantial. Other forms of income came from royalties, expert services, leasing of buildings and some other initiatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Mabe asked if the Disease Priority Matrix had been developed or was still to be established.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Moephuli explained it was a tool which the ARC believed was going to help it in decision-making. For example, it should be possible to know which diseases were important and unimportant for the country, to avoid developing such a specialist vaccine that would only stop disease in a few cows per year - it was more important to focus on developing a vaccine against a disease that killed hundreds of cows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Mncwabe enquired how the ARC was planning to groom local, young researchers and stop recruiting foreign researchers, because it appeared to be focusing on Masters and PhD students, when it spoke of the papers that need to be produced. He also asked if the ARC had got existing links with agricultural colleges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Moephuli said there was not an either / or option - the ARC had to have specialists and if those persons were hard to find locally, then the ARC must consider importing those skills. For instance, South Africa had a specialist in apples, who left for another company, leaving the industry suffering through lack of expertise, because there had not been a succession plan in place. The ARC had to find a specialist overseas, but was also given a mandate to groom youngsters. There was a bursary committee that dealt with these matters, in terms of recruiting students. He added that the ARC needed the best scientists to penetrate even the deep rural areas in order to change the mindset of people, so that they would not ignore or look down upon their indigenous breeds, which often were more disease resistant. He confirmed that the ARC did have links with other agricultural colleges, was working with them, and some ARC scientists were lecturing in these colleges, whist nearby students also visited the ARC campuses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Ramokhoase wanted to know what informed the 8% increase in salaries. He also enquired what the recommendations of the ARC were on possible duplications from other agriculture entities, in order to protect resources and avoid financial losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Moephuli stated the 8% would be applied for the coming year, not for all the previous years. The percentages were different for the previous years. The 8% was a negotiated settlement and cut across the board, and also took into account that the ARC salaries were not comparable to those working at DAFF. He further indicated that the budget cuts had an impact on the rural development projects the entity was running because this meant that plans had needed to be revised, and some of them had been aborted.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Moephuli said that it must be understood that a series of activities had to take place in order to put programmes into existence and have them operate. For example, the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform (DRDLR) had commissioned the ARC to do some work for it. The two entities worked together, but that was not duplication. Even in relation to vaccines, he emphasised that DAFF did not develop vaccines, but would rather ask the ARC to develop them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn remarked that the Committee needed to hold a workshop with the agriculture entities and decide why DAFF and its entities needed more money. It was clear that the entities were doing the work but their impact on the ground was not felt. It may well be that the ARC was indeed focusing on research and development, but that must be considered in the context of how it was actually benefitting other entities or people on the ground. It had become clear that DAFF and its entities needed allocations for one item. That was why the National Treasury found it difficult to allocate money, and why the Committee was also having some difficulty in understanding the matters. Ms Steyn asked for the ratio of women in the ARC top structures. She also asked how far it had gone in finalising its work on the foot and mouth vaccine facility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Moephuli answered that in fact women were in the majority overall. At senior management level they constituted 18%, but at the top level there were none as yet. In relation to the foot and mouth vaccine facility, he reported that a design firm had been appointed. The entity was waiting for the approval of the design by the Board. Once it was approved, the construction would start and funds had been ring-fenced already.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Filtane suggested the ARC must try to find someone who could communicate the research findings or information to ordinary people on the ground; public representatives needed the research information the scientists were producing so that all were on the same wavelength. He also wanted to know more about the relationship is with the DRDLR to ensure ARC researchers interacted with other researchers. Lastly, he wanted to establish how often the entity did psychometric tests for its staff so that it understood it had to develop South Africa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Moephuli asserted that the ties with DRDLR were very strong. Some members of the ARC interacted a lot with other researchers from the DRDLR, and were being commissioned to do work for it. In relation to the psychometric tests, he made it clear the ARC would do competency tests to measure the staff in their ability to deliver on the work they would be doing. For example, if the ARC was looking for a manager, it would do a competency test focusing on leadership skills, and scenarios would be presented to the individual to assess his or her fitness in doing the job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The meeting was adjourned.</p>\r\n",

        "summary": "<p>Three entities of the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) recently appeared before the Portfolio Committee to present their annual performance plans and budget for the 2015/16 period. Whilst the full budget plans were presented, there was little discussion on that aspect, other than noting that the budget of the entire DAFF had been cut substantially.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Onderstepoort Biological Products (OBP) took the Committee through its five strategic goals to illustrate what it had achieved so far and what it intended to achieve. A new organisational structure aligned to strategy had been approved and implemented. The turnover rate of staff was to be maintained between 4% and 12% and the plan was to develop and approve a Succession Planning policy and a retention strategy. It hoped to see an increase in client and stakeholder satisfaction by 2017/18. The marketing strategy had been approved, but still needed to be implemented. A Customer Relations Management strategy would be developed and implemented. A communication strategy had been developed and implemented. The OBP wanted to retain the two new international markets that it had managed to develop each year, and said that it had managed to identify and recapture five lost markets. The annual sales volume, judged on number of doses sold, had increased by 3%. The distribution strategy and its implementation plan have been approved. OBP was targeting support to three projects that assisted the market of smallholders and emerging farmers. It planned to facilitate 22 training sessions or events with smallholder farmers and technicians every year, and to support two agricultural co-operatives (as defined by the Department of Trade and Industry) in rural areas.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMembers enquired if the OBP had a strategy on learnership and internship and questioned if its drawing up of a fraud prevention plan was in response to a specific problem, or if it was being proactive. They questioned the status of the 2014 agreement that the OBP signed with DAFF, wanted to know how the upgrades were going to be done and equipment maintained if there was a decrease in the budget, and asked if OBP was aware that the private sector was doing research to develop its own vaccines. Members called for clarity on plans and time lines for attaining Goods Manufacturing Processes. They questioned whether there was a reason why the OBP should remain as a state entity and whether it was not being given an unfair advantage in doing so, and questioned the problems last year with delivery of vaccines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The South African Veterinary Council (SAVC) highlighted some concerns that hampered the workings of the organisation. These mostly revolved around divisions within the profession, budgetary constraints; and legislative issues. In order to address the lack of unity, the Joint Public Relations Committee and Heritage Committee would be revived to promote and unify the veterinary professions, and involve all stakeholders. It wanted to mobilise its resources properly to create an effective administration and to find the balance between operations and strategy, and improve human resources. For the whole country, there were only 5 845 practitioners, including veterinarians and veterinary specialists and para-professionals, and later, during the questions, indicated that a major concern was that state veterinary services were not situated where they were most needed, and that there was little incentive for state veterinarians, who were being paid on a similar scale to librarians. The SAVC had too few powers to make meaningful interventions into problems besetting the profession and industry. The Threatened and Protected Species (TOPS) regulations published by the Minister of Environmental Affairs prevented veterinarians from doing their work, as it took months to acquire permits, and the SAVC strongly believed that requiring permits on top of registration was not justifiable. There were also problems relating to two pieces of legislation regulating medicines - the Medicines and Controlled Substances Act and the Fertiliser and Feeds Act, whose amendment had still not been put into operation, whilst the regulations to allow for compulsory service of newly-qualified veterinarians were still not developed, with concerns also around the financial implications. The SAVC was concerned that lack of control of veterinary medicines and stock remedies poses a serious risk for food safety and security. It was also involved in litigation over the change to its rules that stated that only veterinarians may be responsible for distribution of certain drugs, and not game farmers. Members wondered if the SAVC had a strategy to recruit young people to the profession and requested clarity on the divisions in the veterinary professions, as well as the definition of &quot;authorised persons&quot;. They asked about the problems with compulsory veterinary community service and asked for further clarity on the legislation controlling medicines, and the possible solution, as well as why farmers were reluctant to comply with the Fertilisers and Feeds legislation, and what the nature of the problem was.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Agricultural Research Council (ARC) focused mainly on pressing human resources issues, the need to upgrade information technology and infrastructure management of the entity. It pointed to the need for a higher ratio of scientists to total staff, particularly at post-graduate level, noted the need to improve the overall qualifications profile of ARC and to expand its base and focus on Masters and PhD candidates, whilst also particularly improving the ratios of women, black and young researchers, and to develop research capacity in emerging national priority science areas such as nanotechnology. It was concerned with the numbers of researchers reaching retirement age, but stated that it did have a strategy to move other more junior staff into these posts. It was investigating the optimal use of ARC land, buildings and equipment for research and development, considering disposal of non-core assets and was seeking to build strong partnerships and collaborations with interested third parties. The budget cuts would have serious implications because there was already a salary agreement and this meant that some of the projects, particularly in the rural areas, might need to be abandoned, whilst there would be no funding for the Economic Competitiveness Programme. Members questioned the succession plans, wondered if the staff were subjected to psychometric testing, and wondered why there was a property strategy whilst its core business was agriculture. Members enquired about possible overlaps between the research entities, and the difference in the core business of the OBP and ARC was explained; the latter dealing with research and development and the former not doing research but manufacturing and distribution. The Members felt that a workshop was needed with all the agriculture entities to decide whether DAFF as a whole needed more money. They asked about the development of the Disease Priority Matrix, whether the ARC should not be focusing on developing staff internally or locally and its collaboration and links with agricultural colleges.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

She mentioned that she sits on the Southern African Development Community Parliamentary Forum (SADC-PF), for which there will be a workshop at the end of March in Johannesburg. Some of the agenda items for today&#39;s Caucus meeting was determined by the upcoming SADC-PF meeting.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Department of Health (DOH) response to the identified needs of the LGBTI community</strong><br />\r\nDr Yogan Pillay, DOH Deputy Director-General: HIV, TB and Maternal, Child and Women&#39;s Health Programmes, presented on behalf of the Minister of Health. He noted that the constitutional and legal provisions would be covered by the Department of Justice. However, Dr Pillay did highlight three provisions in the Constitution, particularly Chapter Two, the Bill of Rights.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe South African National Aids Council (SANAC) has 19 sectors represented, one of these is the LGBTI community. This sector has participated fully in the structure and processes of SANAC over the last three years. The LGBTI sector is also seen as a key population along with other key populations such as injecting drug users and sex workers. In the context of SANAC these groupings are considered vulnerable to HIV acquisition. The concept of key populations is defined by the United Nations agency on HIV and AIDS because of their vulnerability to HIV acquisition and increased stigmatisation. This is not a concept that South Africa has come up with, it is a globally accepted concept. The National Strategic Plan for HIV and Aids, TB and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) (NSP) 2012 &ndash; 2016, acknowledges and provides for key populations. Engagement with these key populations is crucial for a successful HIV response.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Pillay provided an explanation for sero-negative partners, which means that in a couple one partner is HIV-positive and the other one is HIV-negative. Sero-discordant is similar, however this is in long standing couples, where one partner is HIV-positive and the other partner is HIV-negative. Dr Pillay shared that the HIV epidemic in South Africa is a generalised epidemic, meaning that everyone has the risk of acquiring the virus. Within that there are a certain groups that are more at risk, one of whom is the LGBTI community.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Pillay moved on to share the Department&#39;s services and prevention strategies for HIV acquisition. The presentation provides information on services provided for in 2014/15. On the prevention side as a Department, we know that consistent use of male and female condoms protects the user from HIV acquisition and transmission. During this financial year 2014/15, the DOH has distributed 800 million male condoms and 14 million female condoms, free of charge, this includes to the LGBTI community. Dr Pillay said one might ask why there is a difference in the distribution of male and female condoms. He pointed to the difference in cost. Male condoms cost 38 cents each to manufacture, while female condoms on average cost R8 each. DOH has not been able to scale up the distribution of female condoms to the level of male condoms for this reason, however, there has been an increase in the distribution of female condoms from six million to 14 million.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe LGBTI community also requested an increase in the distribution of lubricants in addition to condom distribution. The DOH has been able to respond to this through a donation from the United Nations Population Fund. Five million tubes of lubricant were distributed in 2014, and the DOH has increased that to 20 million tubes in 2015.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith respect to health care workers, there has been an extensive sensitisation programme and training provided on the services and requirements of the LGBTI community. The DOH developed a training manual for health care workers in 2013 which focuses on the health care issues of men who have sex with men, sex workers and people who use drugs. With the support of funding accessed from the US President&rsquo;s Emergency Fund for HIV /Aids Relief (PEPFAR), DOH has established three gay men clinics in Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban. These clinics provided specific support and health care services to men who have sex with men. There are no similar clinics for other members of the LGBTI community.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDOH&#39;s HIV prevention policy was explained. Dr Pillay mentioned that there are three intervention areas: biomedical, socio-behavioural and structural. The DOH has been focusing mainly on the biomedical and socio-behavioural interventions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBased on a series of meetings with leaders from the LGBTI community, some issues were raised which the LGBTI community wants the DOH to respond to. These were 1) Defining the primary health package of services rendered at community health care centres and clinics; 2) The number of people who have tested for HIV/Aids is not disaggregated to how many people from the LGBTI community have tested; 3) Need to revise the post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) guidelines, this is a process that DOH has been doing in any case for everyone. The LGBTI community has been encouraged to engage in the process. Dr Pillay mentioned that the Chair may be aware that the deputy president of SANAC is a representative from the LGBTI community, this indicates that there is a representative involved in the discussions of SANAC.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Pillay explained the acronyms used in his presentation: MSM &ndash; men who has sex with mentioned;<br />\r\nSW &ndash; sex workers; PWID &ndash; person who injects drugs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe LGBTI community has also requested that the key populations (SW and PWID included) have an extended country wide dialogue with government and civil society on their needs. This would be extended to more than just health care needs. The LGBTI community also wanted a greater voice on SANAC, and have its sector specific needs and issues included in the current funding request that is being developed for the Global Fund funding proposal. This will provide financial support to the activities of this sector on HIV and TB related challenges that they face as a community.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn conclusion, Dr Pillay said that one can say that the rights of LGBTI people are recognised by the Constitution, DOH and SANAC. The LGBTI sector is fully represented with regards to HIV/Aids, TB and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) via SANAC. DOH has had meetings with the LGBTI community, these have always been cordial and fruitful. As a Department, we are committed to ensure that the health care needs of the LGBTI community are met and are in line with the legal provisions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><em>Discussion</em></strong><br />\r\nMs B Ngcobo (ANC) asked for a progress report from DOH with regards to funding and the strategy that will be used to deal with this funding.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn ANC Caucus member asked for clarity on why LGBTI people want more inclusion, when it is stated in the presentation that they are active members of SANAC. Why do they want inclusion when they are already included? The Member did not understand why they need to have special requests when they are part of the proceedings. On gay men clinics, she asked about the others in the LGBTI community such as lesbian women, will they not also request this? The community should accept them and gay men and other LGBTI people and they should be included in the community health services. They have to retain their dignity and equality as human beings, and all the rights that we have been fighting for as civil society will be undermined by having separate facilities. What makes female condoms expensive, is due to men. It is one part of society that determines the price, it is not the women. However, women are the ones who are affected. They do not have the power to take decisions when having sex. Women should be able to make these decisions. Patriarchy is depriving half the population from preventing the contraction of this disease. Why should women have to bear the brunt? She did not understand the excuse by DOH on the high cost of female condoms. Why do we not manufacture the condoms ourselves? If we want to reduce the infection rate, and we are concerned about the high infection rate in women, what is stopping us from making the condoms ourselves? DOH must really think about this. South Africa should manufacture the female condom to defend our women.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs S Nkomo (IFP) mentioned that the femidom is a serious matter. If one looks at the 14 million female condoms that are distributed, where does the budget come from, and why is it not increased? More condoms need to be given to women. It is important for women to have access to the female condom. Secondly, we need to address health education about male and female condoms. Is one of the reasons for the lower production of female condoms due to most males being reluctant about women using the femidom? Is there another reason apart from the lack of budget? Is it a matter of health education? What should be done?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe was glad that her colleague had asked about the gay clinics. She was going to ask a similar question from a different angle. We are well into fighting the epidemic, for about 35 to 40 years, however it seems as though we have not adequately educating our communities on the matter. Are we not furthering discrimination towards the LGBTI population, if we have different structures and clinics for them? Ms Nkomo&#39;s final question was on the government&#39;s STI campaign. Where does the campaign start? Ms Nkomo felt that it should begin with our children around sexuality and abstinence programmes. Also providing youth who may be sexually active with prophylaxis, and possibly even educating young girls on secondary virginity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs T Memela (ANC) thanked the presenter for the information provided. She raised concern around children who are finding out about their HIV status only through the circumcision programme happening at the schools. These young people are being told that their HIV was contracted through mother-to-child transmission. They have gone through various health clinic programmes but nothing has been picked up. How are we going to improve this? What is happening in the clinics to monitor the care that is given. These children are finding out about their HIV status only in matric and they could have been treated at birth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs M Khawula (EFF) said there are people who still continue to tell others to pray to be cured of HIV/AIDS. The person might have already started treatment and stops taking it, relying on prayer only. What is being done with those people because they were stopping others from taking their treatments. There was also a problem where couples, both HIV positive and having sex without a condom, they would then have a child that was HIV negative &ndash; how did that happen?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere were no clinics in rural areas, and when there were clinics they were too far and people would need money to travel to them. In these instances, what could be done so that these people could be visited and tested? Also, people who were on treatments would just stop taking their treatments even though government spent a lot of money for the treatment. There were those that had a CD4 count that was below 200 and received no grants so that they could buy food to take with the medication. There were no healthcare facilities in rural areas, why was it that this was not looked into in order to increase access to healthcare for those communities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chair requested the member to keep her question short, and urged members to keep their input strictly to the agenda item. This briefing is about services for LGBTI people and not HIV generally.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Response from DOH</em><br />\r\nDr Pillay supported the Chair&#39;s suggestion for a longer meeting on HIV generally. On the funding issue, the Global Fund provides funding to South Africa for HIV/Aids and TB programmes. The DOH is currently in the process of putting together their proposal for further funding. The LGBTI community asked that the Global Fund proposal include specific funding requests for LGBTI needs. This is in line with the requirements of the Global Fund. The DOH does not have any dedicated funding for this sector, apart from specific sensitisation training and manual development. On the engagement of the LGBTI community at SANAC, he said that there may be fears of exclusion in the larger plenary, and that they may not be equally heard. As SANAC is a large forum with 19 sectors represented, it does happen that there is a conflict of interests and ideas.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Pillay was glad that Members raised the issue about gay clinics as it is something that the Department has also been grappling with. The gay community approached the American donor, PEPFAR, for funds to establish the clinics, in three sites. No government money was used in setting up these clinics, although they are based at DOH facilities, PEPFAR money was used. Dr Pillay is personally in agreement with the thinking of some of the Members about mainstreaming the services to the LGBTI community. However, there are still some people from the LGBTI community who want a dedicated clinic. It is useful to hear the thinking of the Members on this issue. The DOH is currently mainstreaming services, including services around HIV in order to normalise the disease, and in the same way normalise thinking about people&#39;s sexual orientation so that it does not attract additional stigma.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Pillay mentioned that he was worried about the condom issue. The key question is what do we do about this? There has been an increase in the distribution of female condoms and the DOH is committed to increasing this number. It was noted that it is crucial to protect men and women, more specifically women from contracting HIV. For this reason the DOH is keen to investigate the use of microbicides and preventative methods that can be used by women before having sex. It is clear that we need to empower women because of structural issues in society, being a patriarchal society, and this needs to be done in all spheres of society. This is a larger issue which needs to be addressed. The DOH can provide biomedical approaches.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the production of condoms, the DOH does not manufacture condoms. It is up to society and other departments to set up plants to be able manufacture condoms. The main product in condoms is latex, which comes from the rubber tree, however there are no natural resources in South Africa. The bulk of the cost associated with condoms is the importing of latex. There is a synthetic product which is being looked into, however in the past polyurethane was used but this got negative feedback. There is a new material but this is more expensive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith respect to education, research has shown that for there to be effective education campaigns this needs to be run in parallel to service provision. The DOH has a tender out for a large communication campaign on not only HIV, but TB, maternal health and healthy lifestyles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe DOH is working closing with the Department of Basic Education on HIV testing in schools. There has however been some concerns raised by school governing bodies on the roll-out of HIV testing. This is largely due to the presumption made about how one contracts HIV and its relation to being sexually active. This message needs to be changed. There are 400 school health teams that go to schools nationally. There are various health screenings that take place across the grades and the health education is done in an age appropriate manner.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith regards to the post-partum transmission, Dr Pillay shared that DOH does have figures on this occurrence as research has been done in partnership with the Medical Research Council. Some findings show that there has been a decrease in mother-to-child transmission from 8% in 2008 to 2.6% in 2012. The aim is to move towards zero transmission and various steps have been put in place, such as testing the mother before birth, another is providing HIV positive mothers with a lifelong supply of anti-retrovirals, this was initiated in 2014.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Pillay responded to the question on rural health. He mentioned that DOH has built a number of rural health facilities, and where there is not a permanent structure, mobile clinics are used in that particular area. He did note that more needs to be done around rural health, as some people are unable to access health care services due to the terrain, even if the facility is within a five kilometre radius of their home.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chair suggested an extension of the meeting until 16:00 as there seemed to be many questions from the Members. This suggestion was declined by the Members. The Chair indicated that more time is needed for these briefings and that perhaps for the next meeting agenda only one Department should be requested to present.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA final question was posed by the Chair. She said that in the presentation there was mention of female and male services but what about bisexual and people who are transgendered, where do they fit in? Are they comfortable with using a binary system. Where does DOH locate them?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr Pillay explained that bisexual refers to one&rsquo;s sexual orientation or preference and that the person is still biologically a female or male, so would access the respective services.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chair stated that she would like to further engage in the practicality around this and transgender health. She thanked Dr Pillay for his presentation and mentioned that they will be inviting DOH back to present to the Caucus. She said if Members have more questions they should send them to the Caucus secretary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA final request was made from a Member that when DOH completes the Global Fund proposal an inclusion should be made for funds for female condoms.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson asked that Members who still had questions should write them down and give them to the Secretary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson handed over to the Department of Justice to make their presentation; she added that it was not only women being killed because of their sexual orientation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>DOJ briefing on protection of LGBTI persons against violence and other human rights violations</strong><br />\r\nMs Busi Dlamini, National Co-ordinator for the LGBTI Programme, Department of Justice and Constitutional Development (DOJ) mentioned that they were only informed the day before that the briefing was to be given. It was fortuitous that they happened to be in Cape Town for a meeting with the provincial LGBTI committee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Dlamini referred to Section 9 of the Constitution, the Equality Clause, and stated that South Africa was the first country in the world to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation. South Africa has progressive laws and protections and is seen to be way ahead of other countries when it comes to LGBTI rights. However, there is no legislation that addresses hate crimes. The DOJ has introduced a policy framework, and she referred Members to page 8 and 9 of the presentation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe National Task Team (NTT) is comprised of the South African Police Service, the National Prosecuting Authority, the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, the Department of Correctional Services, Department of Basic Education, civil society organisations (CSOs) and Chapter 9 Institutions. The DOH has recently also joined the NTT. This was on request from civil society organisations that are part of the NTT, as it was felt that health issues and the response of DOH is crucial, especially for the LGBTI community. The Rapid Response Team (RRT) focuses specifically on hate crime cases and does follow ups on these cases.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chair interjected and requested that Ms Dlamini move straight to the lessons learnt (pg 18) in the interest of time. It was mentioned that all Members have a copy of the presentation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Dlamini mentioned that Deputy Minister John Jeffrey is a champion of the LGBTI justice issues and is also the Chairperson of the NTT. She said that many CSOs do not have an understanding of how the justice system works, so an action plan has been devised to inform them of the processes around the justice system. CSO members have also been informed that there should be no conflicting messages around hate crimes by members of the NTT. Should a hate crime be reported in the media, the Justice Minister will be the spokesperson for the NTT. CSOs are able to share their views as an organisation, but should not speak on behalf of the NTT.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn closing Ms Dlamini informed the Caucus that the Department is looking for funding to support the multi-sectoral collaborations on LGBTI that need to be established, as well as to fully implement the National Intervention Strategy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><em>Discussion</em></strong><br />\r\nThe Chair noted that there were some slides remaining on the presentation, however questions will be taken on what was presented.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs C Pilane-Majake (ANC) welcomed the presentation. She noted the lessons learnt and the AU Roadmap that is our guide as countries. The Mozambique 2005 conference on Gender Equality was raised and Ms Pilane-Majake shared her concern that this process has been neglected, so she is happy to see DOJ here and raising these issues. She commented that regional and continental initiatives need to be resuscitated.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chair asked what the religious fraternity is saying about the Department&#39;s LGBTI work. Can you explain to us what reactions you get from the religious fraternity and how you deal with those as a Department?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs T Memela (ANC) raised a concern about training of the police, as that is where the problem starts. It would be beneficial is the police could be trained properly to understand the schedules used to sentence perpetrators as that will make a difference. Police need to be trained as it is the path to charging criminals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chair mentioned that she will allow a few more questions however there is a time restriction of one minute per contribution.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs P Chueu (ANC) said that we should not use the word &lsquo;corrective&rsquo; rape as this terminology endorses what the perpetrators are doing &ndash; what are they correcting? If we want to address the issue effectively and remove the stereotype we need to remove the reference to what the perpetrators are calling it. It is rape! Ms <a name=\"__DdeLink__487_1755194036\">Chueu</a> thought that the Department was also going to touch on child marriages in South Africa. She noted that in a meeting that took place on Tuesday 24 March the practice and concept of ukuthwala was being wrongly articulated by the Department publicly and in their documents. Ms Chueu asked the Chair to see how best this question can be responded to.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA member asked for clarity on the roadshows around hate crimes and when they will start being held. The member noted that when we talk about hate crimes most of the people who are becoming victims are young women. Her second question is where does the Moral Regeneration Movement (MRM) feature in this? The DOJ mentioned that there is the angle of social cohesion, which the MRM works with, You could ask them for advice on relational behaviour. Please let us know about your relationship with the MRM.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Khawula asked about the cases when someone was raped and there was evidence, but you hear that the person is told that the investigation is ongoing. The rapist would be back out in the community and the person whose child was raped was never informed. Secondly, what happened when a woman was married into a family and their husband passed away and then woman would be forced to sleep with the late husband&rsquo;s brother? The woman could not say no, because her late husband&rsquo;s family would take all the possession she had. Lastly, in Durban there was a problem with people who sold children &ndash; most culprits were foreigners from countries like Nigeria &ndash; but there were never cases where they were prosecuted and jailed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Response from DOJ</em><br />\r\nMs Dlamini mentioned that the religious fraternity is giving the Department and LGBTI committee a lot of support. In the NTT there are pastors who are lesbian and gay. Faith based organisations (FBOs) are also represented at the various task team meetings. The message that the Department keeps on hearing from the FBOs is that the Bible says we should not judge, and that we should love our neighbour. FBOs have also been identified as a target audience for the communication plan.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith regards to police, as mentioned the national intervention strategy has four areas, the DOJ is currently looking at two. The Department has appointed a service provider to complete an environment scan that will identify existing initiatives on LGBTI, this is scheduled to start in April 2015. Once the scan has been completed, standardised training and awareness material will be developed which will be used within the criminal justice system. The Department has developed a guide for service providers on how to identify and handle a LGBTI case.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Dlamini agreed that the word &lsquo;corrective&rsquo; rape is not appropriate, and that rape is rape. She mentioned that you will not find the word &lsquo;corrective&rsquo; rape in DOJ documents. Ms Dlamini mentioned that the issue of ukuthwala is covered by the Chief Directorate on Vulnerable Groups in DOJ, and that she will forward the concerns raised to them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the hate crimes policy debate, the Justice Deputy Minister has been having discussions with the Chapter 9 Institutions and the Legal Review Committee on which structures and entities are best placed to lead the debate. There is no time frame currently for the debate. Ms Dlamini shared that the MRM is not on the NTT, however, they do play a part on the National Plan on xenophobia and intolerance. We will take your advice to the NTT, the CSOs have been the ones identifying which stakeholders should be represented, however the Department can also make suggestions. Thank you for suggesting the MRM.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs mentioned, DOJ has noted that there needs to be sensitisation training within the criminal justice system, and that victims and their families are kept up to date on the process of their case.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chair expressed thanks to the Departments for their presentations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson said that on the agenda was a discussion on the Southern African Development Community Parliamentary Forum (SADC PF) report on <em>Ukuthwala</em>. She proposed that this discussion be moved to the next meeting. It should be omitted for now because, based on the presentation by the Department of International Relations and Cooperation on 24 March 2015 to the steering Committee &ndash; all members were not satisfied <em>[see report from 24 March 2015]</em>. What was presented was not the <em>Ukuthwala </em>that members knew and the Department was asked to review the presentation. The Committee would have the discussion in the next meeting, it was essential for everyone to give their opinion. Members were clear on what <em>Ukuthwala </em>was and needed to correct any potential distortion of the facts.<br />\r\nThe Committee agreed that the discussion should be held at the next meeting.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson thanked everyone for their participation and support.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe meeting was adjourned.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[The the start of the meeting, apologies from members not attending the meeting were given. A member of the Caucus requested that the apologies that were written should be accepted and verbal apologies merely be noted. The Chair said that she appreciated the written apologies received from members prior to the meeting as it shows their concern for the Caucus meeting and the issues to be discussed].</p>\r\n",

        "body": "<p><strong>Draft South African Country Report to SADC Parliamentary Forum</strong><br />\r\nMs Natalie Leibrandt, Parliamentary Researcher noted that she would present an overview of the South African country reports to the SADC Parliamentary Forum (SADC-PF). This Parliament would be hosting the 37th SADC-PF plenary Assembly in July. According to practice, for each Plenary Assembly, national parliaments are expected to present country reports on a theme that is decided by the SADC-PF&rsquo;s executive committee. The theme for the upcoming Plenary Assembly will be the constitutional and legislative provision enacted to protect children against child marriages.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe explained that the Forum had a Plenary Assembly, the main organ for delivery and policy. The Forum had no legislative powers, but was a forum of parliaments in the SADC set up to discuss issues of mutual concern. It also had a Standing Committee of Human Development and Special Programmes. The Regional Women&#39;s Parliamentary Forum was set up to hear issues from representatives of national Parliaments and the Women&#39;s Caucus.&nbsp; is one and regional women parliamentary forum which is basically a committee where the representative of national parliaments and women&rsquo;s caucus are represented to voice out issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This report would be presented to the Plenary Committee on Women and Social Development. The committee is trying to understand the implications of child marriages in the SADC region, to try to address such marriages holistically at this level. For South Africa, the main focus of the report would be the practice of ukuthwala which, since late 2009, has been regarded as abuse.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe noted that the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development defined ukuthwala as a form of abduction that involves the kidnapping of a girl or young woman, to force her families into a marriage negotiation. No marriage was actually concluded under the traditional practice; it was used as leverage. However, what had been happening recently was that very young girls were being abducted and forced into marrying much older men. This had been recorded in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu Natal (KZN) and reports had been verified by the Gender Directorate of the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development (DOJ&amp;CD) as well as the South African Law Reform Commission (SALRC). However, lack of fully accurate data made it difficult to record exactly how widespread it was. This form of abuse generally happened when men working in he cities returned home during holiday periods. Rationales for using ukuthwala included poverty, it being bandied as a cure for HIV and to &quot;cure&quot; gender stereotypes. It was necessary to judge the impact against the aims of goals of human development, gender equality, poverty and development in the general community.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe noted that from page 4, this Report specifically looked at South Africa&#39;s international obligations around the protection and prevention of child marriages, and all the international conventions and regional and African institutions that it was party to, but also at national legislation relevant to the topic. The South African Law Reform Commission (SALRC), in its reports, had highlighted various loopholes in the legislation that allowed for ukuthwala to be abused. Amongst others, the Recognition of Customary Marriages Act, although it provided for consent to marriage at age 18, did not refer to the minimum age for marriage. In terms of the common law, consent for girls related to those aged 12 to 17, but for boys, 14 to 17. Another loophole in that was the section dealing with social, cultural and religious practices. Although the Act specifically mentioned male circumcision, and virginity testing and female genital mutilation, it did not speak of ukuthwala.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Report recognised that although South Africa did prioritise the well being of children throughout its National Development Plan, there was a challenge because various pieces of legislation did not always speak to each other, and were often contradictory. The Department of Social Development, as the lead department for child protection, with the Departments of Health, Basic Education, and Justice also provided services to children and families but there had been challenges with the coordination of these different activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She noted that the SALRC had conducted various provincial workshops and consultations on the topic. Presently, it was busy collecting all the relevant information in order to determine if there was a need to prepare the Report for the Ministry of Justice. If the DOJ&amp;CD were to find that there was need to legislate on ukuthwala specifically, it would submit legislation to Parliament. The SALRC had recommended new legislation to deal with ukuthwala and how it was being abused. Any new legislation might also be able to consolidate all the different child protection legislation into one instrument. So far, from Parliament&#39;s point of view, it had made reports to the SADC Parliamentary Forum. There was information gathered from discussions in NA and NCOP committees during meetings, but none had specifically suggested legislation. She suggested that it would be useful to wait for the outcome of the SALRC engagement with the DOJ&amp;CD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She added that this was a draft Report, due to be submitted on the following day. More engagement from the delegations and members of the SADC-PF executive was awaited. She asked that any comments from Members be submitted to her as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><em>Discussion</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms M Chueu (ANC) asked who wrote the report and from which references was the information sourced.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Leibrandt responded that she did, and her sources were the DOJ&amp;CD, and the SALRC discussion paper of the last year, on gender directives, that it was using to investigate whether draft legislation on ukuthwala was warranted.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Chueu noted that the definition of ukuthwala, and the Report presented, had not correctly portrayed the woman&#39;s perspective. She quoted part of paragraph 3 on page 1, and said that this misconstrued the African culture. She pointed out that when conclusions are drawn from something that was incorrect to begin with, the solution would also be incorrect. She was saddened that when people were writing for academic purposes, they may not truly understand the culture. There were various gender stereotypes expressed in the Report that really oppressed women, and although she had not read the whole Report in depth, there was much that was negative. It was a sad point that even the people who were responsible for presenting to the SADC had limited understanding of the subject and apparently no passion of keeping women out of their oppression.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She questioned whether the customary marriages legislation was still in force or had been repealed, noting that the Act that came into force in 1961 and at that stage women were not allowed to go to school, and if this legislation had not been repealed it implied that all privileges from which women were deprived at that time were possibly still embedded in the Act. She also had a serious problem with the assertion that girls could be married at a younger age than boys, pointing out that a child is a child, and she would regard it as a real problem bordering on paedophilia should a teenager be married to a much older man, old enough to be her father, and the man should recognise that essentially he is marrying a child. Even if a girl was over 18, the large age gap could still mean that she was subservient to the older partner, and he would still be acting, in her view, similar to a paedophile, and it was even more of a problem that he was probably not regarded as such, quite possibly because he had money, or was lonely, but the point was that the girl probably had not made the decision on her own. Nobody could know whether a girl was being forced into a relationship, because discussions would happen behind closed doors.&nbsp; She wondered why women in general were still allowing things that were restricting women from rising out of oppression. Why was South Africa still allowing the Recognition of Customary Marriages Act to stand with the recognition that a girl as young as 12 could be married? and especially when a boy would only marry at an older age. She insisted that the country could not continue in this way. This Committee must review these policies, and any Acts with any connotation of oppression. Here she cited principles such as women not being able to dispose of property without the consent of her husband, which was equally oppressive. Academics who were making the law should also be helping women to escape oppression and must fully understand all the laws of the country, and align them to affect also the way in which people live their lives.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs B Dlulane (ANC) also wanted to express her dissatisfaction, pointing out that these theories affected the lives of black women, and inflicted more pain on them, and could not be allowed to continue. She wanted to correct the earlier statements, and said that the draft Report could not be allowed to go forward with incorrect information. When she had been Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP, which House had gone on oversight to the Eastern Cape, visiting an area under the leadership of an ikumkani. Traditional leaders, church representatives and community members had attended. There had been 12 girls who managed to run away from the households, and were taken to a safe-house. One of the girls, of 14 years old, who had been abducted by a 45 year old man, ended up having to have a hysterectomy. Their parents, the perpetrators of ukuthwala and the go-betweens were all charged and she believed had been imprisoned. The Stakeholders Forum continued to exist and there was a report to the NCOP. There was nothing in this Report however on that matter. She was insistent that wrong information had been conveyed in this current Report.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs S Nkomo (ANC) agreed that the information contained in the current Report would be &quot;stirring up a hornet&#39;s nest&quot;. She pointed out that Members here were becoming upset by the information, but did not even have information on where the statements had been captured. She knew the presenter, but also recognised that some of the research seemed to have emanated from a researcher in KwaZulu Natal, who had fed her research through the Commission for Gender Equality. There were some good points in the report, which could be debated and discussed, but other information was missing. There was also the point that different recommendations had come from different committees of Parliament. She believed that additional information should have been sourced to compile the Report, and possibly a central source for reporting should be found. She thought, for instance, reports from the NCOP&#39;s visit mentioned earlier would be important. If the Report was delivered in its current format, with the critical missing links, it would be assumed to be an authentic portrayal of ukuthwala. She noted the short time frames, and said she thought it was important for this Committee to seriously recommend how the process should unfold, who needed to be present, and with whom there should be engagement to get the document right.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs N Khunou (ANC) asked who one of the people in the meeting was.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Natasha Paulsen introduced herself, at the request of the Chairperson, explaining that she was representing the Griqua Rural and other constituencies in Western Cape. She was sitting in on proceedings of various committees to find out what was going on, to be able to then report back to communities on who Parliamentary representatives were and what they were doing for communities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson asked if she had come with someone else.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Paulsen explained that she was part of a group in Parliament, for the whole session, until 2 April.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson, said that, from the point of view of protocol, somebody should have brought Ms Paulsen. She said that &quot;this is a Committee in Parliament and it is not attended by people (from) outside&quot;. If Ms Paulsen wanted to know the proceedings of Parliament there was another way to find that out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Paulsen said that she had been understood that her group was invited by Parliament to all the sittings.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson commented that nobody had approached this Committee. This was a closed meeting. From a protocol point of view, anyone else to be attending should have contacted the Chairperson, as this was essentially a meeting making preparations, and was not a public and open hearing. She suggested that Ms Paulsen inform the right people and request permission to attend the meeting on the following day.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Khunou agreed with comments of other Members. If this Report was presented to the SADCPF, it was suggesting that South Africa was not doing anything, implied that it was not a caring society, and that it was oppressing women. She thought that the research had to be broadened. Much had been done by this government since 1994, as far as women and children were concerned. She recalled having attended a summit on termination of pregnancy, where it was agreed that &quot;child&quot; would be one under 21 years old, and prior to that the child was not able to consent - meaning that this person would be regarded as an adult only after 21. She was not sure when that notion had changed, and why this did not form part of the document. She felt that the problem was that the country was trying to follow a Western path, and losing its own ways and being unable to track what it was doing.&nbsp; She felt that more people with sound knowledge had to be engaged on the definition of ukuthwala. She agreed that this Report should not be presented and far more input was needed. She wondered who had given this topic to this Committee in the first place, and why it was only being told now that the deadline was the following day. She felt that a full report had to be prepared that all South Africans must agree on as the country report. This Parliament was &quot;not NGOs who go in there to lie about South Africans, we cannot do that&quot;. She agreed with the views of other Members. She believed that this Committee had a duty now to check all the policies, and needed to correct them. The Department of Women in the Presidency must ensure that the legislation was repealed or revised, because women were still being oppressed. She was not intending to attack the presenter, but was insistent that the Report needed further work, and Members here would be able to go and look at some of the literature mentioned. She suggested that this should be the priority of this Committee for the forthcoming term.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Tumi Morogwe, Parliamentary Researcher, pointed out that the Report was supposed to focus on legislation and that was perhaps the reason why so much of what Parliament had done by way of public hearings and oversight was not mentioned in the Report.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson suggested that Ms Morogwe was out of order. She said that the reason she had asked for these Reports to be brought to the steering committee was because this steering committee was leading the Multi-Party. Other people would be commenting in a broader meeting on the following day. She also had a concern about this matter coming back; the issues were raised when dealing with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and it had helped South Africa when preparing the report for the Convention on the Status of Women in New York, two years previously. She wondered if the report on ukuthwala that was used for the MDG meetings was available. She felt, with no disrespect to the presenter personally, that the Department of International Relations and Cooperation was taking this Committee for granted; Members remembered what they had done in the past. This Report was not acceptable, left out a lot of information and misinterpreted ukuthwala - something that she was well aware of personally, because of her age, although she pointed out that her Xhosa secretary understood it differently. People had been through ukuthwala in different ways, but Parliament was not happy about presenting this Report.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Leibrandt confirmed that the Report was based on the findings of the SALRC, as published in a Discussion Paper in the previous year. Up to January 2015, the SALRC had been holding provincial consultations. The SALRC fell under the DOJ&amp;CD and its reports were considered to be a government publication.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson said that the Committee would be calling in the SALRC to account.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Leibrandt explained further that because she had used a government publication as her main source, which was the most recent publication, she had assumed that it would be reliable. She was grateful for the comments of the Committee, which were pointing out inaccuracies in the definition. She asked that the Committee help her to compile a proper definition, because was now placed in a difficult situation; what was said in the literature and what the Committee Members were saying was contradictory.&nbsp; She also added that the Report was focusing on the legislative and constitutional provisions, and she could do nothing to change laws already in place, but could only provide an overview.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs N Majeke (IFP) agreed with the recommendation to call in the SALRC. The presenter had noted that she had merely extracted information from a government public report, but if this was to be a comprehensive report, it had to encompass every detail and deal with what South African women were talking about.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Nkomo wanted to outline the powers and duties of the Committee. It had the right to call anybody to come and account to it. The Committee would be looking at other legislation. Since it was clear that the Report was drawn on the basis of the SALRC documentation only, the Committee wanted to look at broader sources, including other reports mentioned earlier. All the relevant information must be given. She had mentioned a researcher in KwaZulu Natal and suspected that the SALRC&#39;s information had come from her. This Committee could not compromise on its role, knew that it must oversee diligently, and whoever the information came from, that body should be called in (even subpoenaed). She thought that the proper definition of ukuthwala could be obtained from all the documents and suggested that &quot;we will not be defining ukuthwala for you&quot;. Whilst she appreciated the preliminary work done, it had to be taken further for the Committee would not give its support to the current draft Report being released.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Dlulane questioned whether any research was obtained from the NCOP.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Leibrandt confirmed that she had received information from an NCOP researcher, Tasneem Matthews, and that information had also informed the draft Report.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Dlulane thought that further information could be given by the Committee, if the Chairperson was agreeable, because it seemed that the scope of the research was not broad enough. The Committee was not hiding anything and was quoting facts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson suggested that the information given today by Members should be noted, and their concerns highlighted when the presenter reported back.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Minutes of previous Committee meeting </strong><br />\r\nThe Committee discussed the minutes of the previous meeting, but raised problems and issues with the construction of the paragraphs and the information. Members highlighted paragraph 3, and said it was unclear whether the topics were discussed or agreed upon.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMembers decided that in future the minutes must clearly record the details and decisions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Other business: Planning</strong><br />\r\nThe Committee broadly discussed the planning for the following day&#39;s meeting, and agreed to raise the following issues;<br />\r\n- Hosting of Women&#39;s Parliament<br />\r\n- Programming and time allocation<br />\r\n- Budget<br />\r\n- Allocations to other committees<br />\r\n- Infrastructure, training and capacity building<br />\r\n- Summary on Beijing Report to be delivered by Committee Researcher<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe meeting was adjourned.</p>\r\n",

        "summary": "<p>The Parliamentary Research Office presented a draft Report on the protection of children against child marriages in South Africa, which had been compiled for tabling to the SADC-Parliamentary Forum (PF) Plenary Assembly. The Plenary was trying to understand the implications of child marriages in the SADC region, to address such marriages holistically at this level. For South Africa, the main focus of the Report would be the practice of ukuthwala which, since late 2009, has been regarded as abuse. The document presented therefore focused on the concept of ukuthwala, and other legislative and constitutional provisions, as well as South Africa&#39;s obligations to protect the rights of children and women in light of its signature of various conventions internationally and in the region.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Department of Justice and Constitutional Development (the Department) and the South African Law Reform Commission (SALRC) had conducted research and ukuthwala had been defined as a form of kidnapping of young girls or women, in order to force their families into marriage negotiations. The SALRC had identified a number of loopholes in other legislation, particularly the Recognition of Customary Marriages Act, which did not set any minimum age for marriage, but referred to consent for marriages of girls between 12 and 17, but for boys aged 14 to 17. There was concerned that recognition of customary law and traditions might be allowing for the practice of ukuthwala to be abused. The SALRC was compiling a report which would make recommendations whether there was a need for specific legislation to cover the issues, although no draft legislation had yet been formulated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members were not at all happy that the draft Report be publicised. They shared the view that the Report was based on the perspective of a person with no in-depth knowledge of the practices, and several commented that the definition of ukuthwala was incorrect, although there was also a comment that those from different backgrounds and ages might well see the concept differently. They felt that the Report failed to include other perspectives, as well as failing to consider what the NCOP had reported a few years ago when it conducted extensive oversight, and felt that it was disrespectful to black women. Members also commented that there was a real need for this Committee to engage with all the legislation that was keeping women unempowered, and that should be a focus for the next term. One Member commented that she thought she knew the main source of the information but that far more research and other views were required, to avoid a one-sided interpretation being regarded as authentic. The Committee felt that the SALRC should be asked to come and account to the Committee for the Discussion Paper on which this report was largely based.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members briefly discussed the planning for the following day&#39;s meeting and discussed the minutes of a previous meeting, sending them back for clarity.</p>\r\n",

        "body": "<p><strong>AGSA Presentation</strong><br />\r\nMr Stephanus Kok, Senior Manager: AGSA, centred his presentation of the annual performance plans of the Department for 2015/16 on three programmes:&nbsp; Food Security and Agrarian Reform, Forestry and Natural Resource Management, and Fisheries: Marine Living Resource Fund. He also presented the budget for the 2015/16 period.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProgramme 3: Food Security and Agrarian Reform<br />\r\nThe AG found that 13% of targets were not measurable and 13% of indicators were not verifiable. The strategic objective is to lead and coordinate government food security initiatives. A number of hectares of under-utilised land in communal areas have been cultivated for production. The target set for the current period is 120 000 ha. A 30% data sample would be collected from each province at the end of the planting season. The indicator was not verifiable because Annexure E stated that the Department would only verify information on a 30% sample basis. So the total population would, therefore, not be measurable or verifiable.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProgramme 5: Forestry and Natural Resource Management<br />\r\nThe AG discovered that 22% of targets were not measurable, and 11% of targets were not specific. 22% of indicators were not verifiable. Against the strategic objective of ensuring the conservation, protection, rehabilitation and recovery of depleted and degraded natural resources, indicators stated that a number of hectares in irrigation schemes have been revitalised. The target set for the current period is 250 ha. Annexure E states that a number of hectares that have been revitalised would be collected from the reports of the PDAs because PDAs comply with the reporting procedure of CASP and the Ilima/Letsema Funding programme. The AG reported that Annexure E does not specify what supporting documentation, other than the reports, would be collected from the PDA reports to ensure that the target is measurable.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIndicators state that a number of plantations for Forest Stewardship Council have been certified. The target set for the current period is one. Annexure E indicates that a service provider would evaluate data against agreed external standards. However, Annexure E does not specify the specific data that would be collected from the service provider.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProgramme 6: Fisheries: Marine Living Resources<br />\r\nThe AG pointed out that 11% of targets were not specific and 33% of indicators were not well defined. The strategic objective is to ensure increased production and productivity in prioritised areas as well as value chains. The indicator states that the number of Aquaculture catalyst projects identified and listed under Operation Phakisa was supported, and that for the 2015/16 target, phase 1 for the four Operation Phakisa Projects has been supported. The indicator per the annual performance plan, read in conjunction with the target does not define the type of support that is required in order to achieve the objective.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn sustainable use of natural resources in the sector, the target for the current period is to recover plans for the three sectors: Abalone, West Coast Rock Lobster and Deep Sea Water Hake. The plans have been updated. The indicator plans to recover and maintain prioritised fish stocks. The AG maintained that the indicator per the annual performance plan, read in conjunction with the target, is not well defined, as the indicator should measure the achievement of the plan.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith regard to enabling the environment for food security and sector information, the target for 2015/16 is to develop sector specific policies and allocate rights to nine fishing sectors. The indicator indicates that rights to nine sectors have been allocated. The AG said the indicator per annual performance report, read in conjunction with the target, is not clear. Based on the assessment of the AG, the indicator should measure compliance and achievement on the FRAP framework.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Medium Term Strategic Framework Outcomes were not fully reported in the APP where DAFF was allocated as the lead department.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOutcome 4: Decent employment through inclusive economic growth<br />\r\nThe target for the first year saw a number of small-scale producers supported towards increased market participation and employment; and to implement proposals monitored by DAFF and National Treasury. By 2019 the target is to support 300 000 new small holders. The indicator talks about the development of smallholder production in the context of improved district planning and the link to land reform, extension, marketing and other systems. The target included in the final draft of the APP states that 1498 smallholders would be linked to the markets in five years. The AG pointed out that the five-year target listed (1498) does not agree with the annual target listed. The AG was also not able to establish whether the 2019 target of 300 000 new smallholders would be met due to a breakdown per department not being available.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOutcome 7: Vibrant, equitable, sustainable rural communities contributing towards food security for all<br />\r\nThe first year MTSF target is to have 4,3 million vulnerable people benefiting from food security and nutrition initiatives and by March 2019 to have 1,6 million beneficiaries; and to have 1 million hectares by March 2019. The target included in the APP final draft indicates that 400 000 households per annum would be benefiting from food and nutrition security initiatives; and 120 000 ha of under-utilised land in communal areas would be cultivated for production every year. The indicator mentions implementing the comprehensive food security and nutrition strategy, and developing under-utilised land in communal areas and land reform projects for production.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe AG indicated that based on discussions held with the Strategic Planning directorate and per inspection of the MTSF outcome, other departments are supporting DAFF to achieve the 2019 target. However, the breakdown of how the 4,3 million and 1,6 million targets for food security, and the 1 million target for hectares would be achieved was not available.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOutcome 10: Protect and Enhance our Environmental Assets and Natural Resources<br />\r\nThe target for the first year of MTSF is to rehabilitate 152 500 ha of land, and the target included in the APP final draft indicates 80 000 ha. The AG commented that the indicator is included in Programme 5: Forestry but the target set is set at 80 000 ha and not 152 500 ha.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>(Graphs and tables were shown to illustrate budget 2015-2016: comparisons between current year and previous year, current payments, transfers and subsidies, and payment of capital goods)</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinancial and Fiscal Commission (FFC) Presentation<br />\r\nProfessor Nico Steytler, Commissioner, FFC, took the Committee through the employment state of agriculture in the country; Departmental MTEF analysis; Strategic Performance Plan and Annual Performance Plan of DAFF; assessment of conditional grants; and agriculture related recommendations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere has been consistent decline in agricultural employment over time from 1,8 million in 1962 to 764 000 in 2013. This trend has continued with the labour force survey showing nett job losses in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to 2013. The long-term trajectory of the sector raises questions about the effectiveness of existing interventions to turnaround job creation prospects. The outlook for 2015 is expected to put further upward pressure on food prices with the recent increase in the fuel levy and policy on cost-reflective electricity tariffs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe National Development Plan (NDP) informs the focus of the Department over the medium term and relates to increasing food security, creating decent jobs in its sectors, and increasing the contribution of these sectors to the national GDP. Over the 2015 MTEF period the DAFF is allocated a total of R19, 5 billion. This represents a real annual average decline of 5, 2% per annum. The decline is the result of Cabinet-approved reductions amounting to R158 million in 2015/16. The reductions are in areas of compensation to employees, goods and services and conditional grants. This is mainly due to persistent under spending and the build up of cash reserves.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Agricultural Production, Health and Food Safety Programme is said to consume the largest share of the budget of DAFF over both periods reviewed. Over the 2015 MTEF period, the proportion of the budget allocated to Food Security and Agrarian Reform Programme highlights the priority attached to food security. R834.8 million has been reprioritised to Fetsa Tlala over the 2015 MTEF while Ilima/Letsema was allocated R1, 5 billion to boost food production in previously disadvantaged farming communities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPertaining to SPP and APP, DAFF spent 99.1% and 98.9% of its total budget in 2012/13 and 2013/14 respectively. The reasons for the 2013/14 under spending relate to delays in the processes of the Department of Public Works (DPW); incomplete procurement processes; and transfer payments withheld as a result of under spending by a province.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDAFF intends to implement a stakeholder engagement strategy that may relate to addressing coordination blockages from other sector departments such as the DPW, and to implement the IGR forums in each province so as to strengthen support to provinces.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn relation to the level of spending 99% of budget, the achievement of targets in 2013/14 was standing at 75%. Despite this low ratio, the number of indicators for 2015 has increased by 40% while the budget has risen by 4% to 2013/14. The assessment of the two largest programmes of the Department &ndash; Agricultural Production and Food Security, indicates targets have also not been scaled down to account for the minimal rise in the budget.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProf Steytler said the AG raised a number of key findings in its 2013/14 audit report. Concerning cases of irregular and fruitless expenditure, the APP indicated that DAFF would review and implement a fraud prevention and anti-corruption strategy and timeframe for resolving misconduct cases. Regarding the non-existent audit committee, it is unclear from APP how DAFF intends to ensure the audit committee is functional. It is difficult to monitor whether this issue the AG raised would be achieved in 2015/16.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn insufficient oversight of reporting and internal controls, the APP points out that DAFF intends to implement a three-year rolling strategic plan to address the gap the AG identified. Pertaining to no risk assessment or management strategy, the APP shows that DAFF intends to conduct a risk assessment and review the risk management strategy in 2015/16.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAgricultural conditional grants have experienced a real decline over the MTEF period as a result of under spending, especially with respect to the CASP grant. The main reasons for under spending include poor planning, contractor challenges, late changes to business plans and weak and ineffective procurement processes. It is felt that effective intergovernmental (IG) coordination is crucial in order to achieve optimal grant performance. Besides establishing IGR forums in each province, it is unclear how DAFF intends to address some of the practical implementation challenges related to the conditional grants.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn his conclusion, he shared with the Committee some recommendations. First, the Commission stated that DAFF should strengthen its ability to enforce the conditions in the grant framework to ensure better oversight of provinces so that spending and performance of agricultural conditional grants could be improved. Second, the Commission recommended that special focus be put on improving the operations of different food security programmes that accelerate reduction in household food security without necessarily increasing programme expenditure.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThird, the government should clarify the legislative mandate and responsibility of municipalities in relation to food security. DAFF should develop a policy on urban food security with concrete proposals on how such a mandate would be funded. Fourth, the terms of reference for the Committee to review the conditional grants should be finalised. The review should be comprehensive in scope and include assessing the value chain of conditional grants and unlocking operational constraints related to planning, procurement, comprehensive smallholder support, cash-flow and monitoring and evaluation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally, the government should consider developing a vulnerability index to isolate households that are vulnerable to climate change and other shocks. Any fiscal and financial interventions to alleviate the impact of climate change should take into account the differential vulnerabilities of rural communities and aim to support their autonomous adaptation responses. These comprise promotion of multi-purpose crop production, small grains, drought and water stress tolerant crop varieties and improved agronomic practices.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDAFF SPP, APP and APAP Presentation<br />\r\nProfessor Edith Vries, Director-General: DAFF, briefed Members about key issues affecting the agricultural sector in the country and the interventions that would be made through the programmes of the Department; and indicated that APAP is a replacement agriculture strategy that comprises sectoral key action programmes and provides a long-term vision and focused interventions in a five-year rolling schedule.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn analysis of some key issues, it emerged that thousands of hectares of under-utilised arable land in the former homelands are posing a challenge. The land in these communal areas would be put into production with focused support for input access, technical support and linkages to local markets. The increased movement of goods and people has led to increased risk to the country and the necessity for increased measures to anticipate and prevent possible introduction of animal diseases, plant pests and other undesirable articles such as unsafe food and feed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe challenge of growing the smallholder sector is closely tied up with the challenge of making smallholder agriculture more remunerative. Currently more than half of all smallholder households live below the poverty line. Market access for developing producers has also been identified as one of the key challenges for the Department.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the main limitations with fisheries is that catch volumes depend on fish stocks that vary naturally and are subject to depletion owing to over-exploitation. Inshore species tend to be in a state of stock depletion. This leads to an increase in illegal fishing and poaching and increasing demand for access to finite marine resources.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProf Vries pointed out a decline in both softwood and hardwood plantation areas planted since the mid 1990s, and there has been an increase in the area for pulpwood purposes compared to the area for saw logs and mining timber. Shortages of timber products have been recorded.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt was indicated that the strategic planning process and performance monitoring and reporting is an institutionalised business process. The presentation focused on the six programmes and what they intend to achieve.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProgramme 1: Provision of leadership and administrative support to achieve sector and all organisational goals in accordance with prescribed framework<br />\r\nThe programme, within five years, intends to maintain a sound system of internal controls and risk management through the implementation of:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRisk management plan, development of an internal audit plan, and fraud and corruption prevention strategy<br />\r\nEffective oversight of departmental performance management<br />\r\nReduction in the number of days to finalise misconduct cases<br />\r\nImprovement in the financial management to obtain unqualified audit opinion<br />\r\nLegislation review programme<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe programme is focusing on strengthening relations and communication between national, provincial and international stakeholders through the coordination of institutional structures and development of media plans. It also institutionalises integrated planning processes and mechanisms to reflect the broad strategic outcomes of government by providing oversight to public entities; ensuring a common project management approach; strengthening the sector information management system; and coordinating the policy and research agenda to align with the mandate of the Department and key strategic priorities and protocols.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProgramme 2: Enhancing production, employment and economic growth in the sector<br />\r\nThe programme is working towards promoting animal production and products through monitoring the implementation of animal and plant improvement schemes for prioritised value chain commodities. It enforces regulatory frameworks to reduce the level of disease outbreaks in production areas to a minimum by ensuring animal diseases management and access to primary health care services through the implementation of the Animal Diseases and Management Plan; conducting planned plant disease and pests risk surveillance; conducting planned animal disease and African horse sickness risk surveillance; and implementing regulatory compliance and monitoring interventions to prevent plant and animal disease outbreak. Auditor-General of South Africa (AGSA) on the<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProgramme 3: Enabling environment for food security and sector transformation<br />\r\nThe programme would institutionalise the National Policy on Food and Nutrition Security initiatives by 2019/20 by increasing the number of households benefiting from food and nutrition security initiatives by 200 000; supporting 80 000 smallholder producers and cultivating 600 000 hectares of under utilised land in communal areas for production.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe programme would also improve delivery capacity in support of sustainable growth in the sector through the implementation of the National Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Training and Education Strategy and National Policy on Extension and Advisory Services.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurther, it would provide strategic leadership to ensure effective and efficient utilisation of all producer development support through the development and implementation of the Comprehensive Producer Support Policy and creation of 110 000 jobs through CASP and Ilima/Letsema by 2019/20.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProgramme 4: Sustainable use of natural resources in the sector<br />\r\nThe target over the next five years is to improve market access through the implementation of the:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSouth African-Good Agricultural Practices (SA-GAP), global GAP and SA-Livestock-GAP certification programmes<br />\r\nCitrus Emerging Export Excellence Programme<br />\r\nFruit and Aquaculture Value Chain Round-Table Network<br />\r\nTrade Strategy and International Relations Strategy<br />\r\nTrade Competitiveness Development Plan<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProgramme 5<br />\r\nWorking towards ensuring the conservation, protection, rehabilitation and sustainable forest management by:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRevitalising hectares on irrigation schemes<br />\r\nCreating 7 875 jobs through the refurbishment of Category B and C plantations<br />\r\nPromulgating the Preservation and Development of Agricultural Land Framework Bill by Parliament<br />\r\nCreating 4000 full-time equivalent jobs through the Land Care programme<br />\r\nCertifying three plantations for the Forestry Stewardship Council<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Programme 6</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThrough this programme, within five years the Aquaculture Bill would be implemented; support would be provided to aquaculture catalyst projects for sustainable development of the aquaculture sector as per Operation Phakisa and supporting research projects; and 2 251 jobs would be created through Working for Fisheries programme.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis would also see the development and implementation of the Framework for the allocation of fishing rights and the implementation of the Small-Scale Fishing Policy to alleviate poverty, promote food security and to ensure access to marine living resources.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe programme aims to ensure compliance and management of fish stocks through the implementation of the Integrated Fisheries Security Strategy enforcement mechanisms to combat illegal fishing activities; and updating recovery plans for Abalone and West Coast Rock Lobster to increase fish stock levels.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n(Graphs and tables were shown to illustrate staff establishment and budget breakdown: per programme and per economic classification)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAPAP<br />\r\nProfessor Vries enlightened the Committee that the APAP programme is modelled on the Industrial Policy Action Plan (IPAP). It comprises sectoral key action programmes (commodities) and transversal key action programmes (research and innovation). It introduces an export-led and import substitution, replacement agriculture strategy. It provides a long-term vision and focused interventions in a five-year rolling schedule.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe purpose of the sectoral and transversal key action programme for the APAP is to begin to address the growing concentration within the market which impacts on job creation and seeks to localise food networks through infrastructure development and incentivising support for SMMEs and small-scale producers across the agriculture, forestry and fisheries value chain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCriteria for the selection of role players in the sector focused on contribution to food security, job creation, growth potential, and potential contribution to trade balance. Some of the role players the presentation focused on for priority value chains and transversal action programmes include, amongst others: red meat, poultry, wheat, forestry, and fisheries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPoultry<br />\r\nThe consumption of white meat is expected to expand by 34%. This increase is supplemented through high levels of imports. High animal feed prices dampen domestic production. Despite an increase in domestic Soya production of over 300% since 1999, it is a far cry in keeping up with a rising demand for animal feed. The strategy is to increase production of poultry and animal feed with the aim of lowering feed costs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe International Trade Administration Commission provided protection against a surge of low cost imports of poultry products. Risks are around increasing energy prices and unstable energy supplies, and increasing input costs in fertiliser, animal feed, fuel and mechanisation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Strategic Infrastructure Projects (SIP11) increased infrastructure investment in poultry, soybean and yellow maize production and processing, and established hatcheries for parent stock. The plan is to improve support packages to poultry and soybean producers; expand training programmes in support of smallholder farmers; and strengthen the Agri Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment support for the poultry industry.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTargeted areas are KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo, Mpumalanga, Gauteng and Eastern Cape, and the project is expected to start in April 2015. Leading departments are National Agricultural Marketing Council (NAMC), DAFF, Department of Rural Development and Land Reform (DRDLR), Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) and Agricultural Research Council (ARC). It is hoped that these actions would add 14 481 jobs to the current 107 784 jobs through increased tonnage of 663 500 poultry production by 2019. The interventions would increase the current levels of smallholder and subsistence producers by 5% in 2019.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRed Meat<br />\r\nRed meat consumption has increased by about 20% since the early 1990s, and it is projected to increase by a further 20% by 2023. South Africa has consistently imported about 10% of its red meat consumption needs over the past 10 years. It is stated that he country could rely less on imported frozen meat if it could improve market linkages with the vast herd in the former homelands. The legislation has to work on introducing the Animal Improvement Policy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSip 11 has increased investment in livestock production systems to develop the livestock value chain in communal areas. This would be done by expanding training programmes of extension officers in support of smallholder farmers; activating mobile veterinary clinics for remote areas to provide basic animal healthcare services; and enhancing LandCare and Rangeland Monitoring and Improvement Programme. There would be a review and assessment of the Vet and Animal healthcare strategies and programmes according to OIE requirements.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis project is expected to start in April in all provinces. Leading departments are NAMC, DAFF, DRDLR, DWS, Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA), Independent Development Corporation (IDC) and ARC. It is believed it is going to improve income generation schemes through improved market access for smallholder farmers; and it would increase contribution to gross value of Agriculture GDP from 12,5% to 15% by 2019. The smallholder production would by 2019 increase by 5%.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWheat<br />\r\nSouth Africa was able to supply 93% to 97% of the domestic demand in 2000/01 to 2002/03. The domestic consumption has since doubled while production has remained static. There are different perspectives on whether South Africa must be self-sufficient in wheat yet the present levels of import dependence are excessive, and that is impacting on the bread price. The strategy is to increase land under production for domestic consumption.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInvestment from the IDC is improving the milling capacity of the Western Cape and the Free State in order to improve returns to farmers. A SIP7 infrastructure investment in rail transport would decrease transport costs. A decrease in public and private investment in research and development of wheat cultivars might pose a risk, and it would also be around declining average gross income per hectare.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSIP11 looks at reducing bulk transport costs by progressively increasing the use of rail that would determine options for expanding the wheat milling capacity in the Western Cape. Production would be increased through the recapitalisation and development of support provided to smallholder farmers by capacitating rural youth engaged in wheat production and processing; providing on-farm infrastructure to new farmers; and improving export market access for the surplus production of the exceptional high quality wheat of South Africa. A training and communication system is going to be developed to support extension staff with technical and advisory support services for wheat production.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is scheduled to commence in April 2015 and is going to take place in the Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng and Western Cape. Participating departments are DAFF, DRDLR, NAMC, IDC, DEA and Department of Science and Technology. It is envisaged this would create an additional 8000 new jobs to the existing 28 000 by 2019; increase production from 1, 2 mil tons by an additional 200 000 tons by 2019; reduce the levels of imports by 10% from the current 50%; and increase gross income which is currently at R3 billion by R180 million.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nForestry<br />\r\nThe uptake of low a forestation is reported to be due to the cumbersome licensing processes, under-investment in long rotation uses such as timber for saw logs, and dominance by a few big, vertically-integrated forestry operations. The availability of fibre is identified as the key constraint.&nbsp; The increase in the afforested area; and the rehabilitation and improved management of the categories B and C and re-commissioning of state-owned forests are two principal sources for maintaining and increasing the availability of fibre.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRisks centre around under-investment especially in long-rotation forestry for timber, cumbersome water licensing requirements, environmental risks, increasing input costs, financial constraints for refurbishment, and poor public and private investment in research.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nActions to be taken involve the review of conditions around the issuing of water licenses; utilisation of settlement land claims process to transform the sector because plus minus 50% of forestry land is under land claims; and re-commissioning of the Western Cape and Mpumalanga and replanting is going to commence in all exited areas.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is penned to commence in April 2015 and is going to take place in the Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, Western Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and North West. Departments that are taking part are DAFF, DRDLR, NAMC, IDC, DEA and DWS. It is envisioned this would bring 100 000 ha from 10 000 that are targeted in the Forest Transformation Charter. 147 000 ha would result in 9 800 jobs in the primary sector and 39 200 in processing resulting in 49 000 jobs created. 22 000 ha in the Western Cape are due for replanting while in Mpumalanga the figure is standing at 4000 ha.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFisheries and Aquaculture<br />\r\nThe Fisheries sector is facing depleted stocks of marine and coastal wild capture fisheries, but shows enormous potential in terms of aquaculture. The strategy is to provide the legislative framework for developing small-scale fishers and fishing communities within strategic fisheries zones; and to establish the Aquaculture Sector through the institutionalisation of support, key services, and regulatory framework.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe legislation that would be key in this area is the Small-Scale Fisheries Policy, Marine Living Resources Amendment Bill, and Act No 18 of 1998 that makes provision for small scale fisheries sector, the Aquaculture Bill, and Freshwater fisheries policies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nActions taken would be around the implementation of 23 aquaculture catalyst projects; establishment of an Interdepartmental Authorisations Committee; establishment of an Aquaculture Development Fund; and Government Preferential Procurement.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is planned to start in April 2015 and is going to take place in the Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. Departments that are taking part are DAFF, DRDLR, DEA and National Treasury. This is expected to help in the implementation of the Phakisa Plan on Aquaculture as a growth sector and development zones in order to achieve the following by 2019:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGDP growth of at least R3 billion through the aquaculture sector<br />\r\n15000 decent jobs could be created in the aquaculture sector<br />\r\nGrow the fish consumption of South Africa from 8kg to 19kg/capita<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUpdate on APAP<br />\r\nProfessor Vries mentioned that Cabinet approved the finalised APAP and Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Strategic Framework. DAFF and DRDLR have devoted the last quarter (January &ndash; March 2015) to fast-track readiness to implement on the 1st of April. Focus areas, amongst others, are on:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpatial planning<br />\r\nRobust stakeholder and communications strategy<br />\r\nInstitutional arrangements<br />\r\nLand acquisition<br />\r\nResearch and development<br />\r\nFunding model<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is hoped that if things are favourable, by 2019 the APAP would have increased the number of small holders from 164 000 in 2012 to 400 500; increased the value add of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries from R42.5 billion to R48.9 billion; increased the number of jobs in Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries from 660 00 to 822 500 and a potential 1 million jobs by 2030; and decreased the value of diesel, fertiliser and machinery imports at an annual average of R9.6 billion to R7.4 billion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDiscussion<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>AGSA and FFC Presentation</em><br />\r\nMs A Steyn (DA) asked how food security is measured and who the role players are; and how the AG measures outcomes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProfessor Nico Steytler said food security should be looked from both the production side and consumption side. Many role players are involved and the Department is not the only player in this area. It works together with the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform on matters regarding the size of the land, for example. So, the link is very important between the two departments.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Kok, on the measurement of outcomes, explained that the AG looks at what the Department wants to achieve. The Department can achieve what it intends to do during the year. But if there is no growth or improvement in what it wants to achieve, then it must be understood that the intended objective has not been achieved. That gets reported as not having achieved anything though the target was set.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr T Ramokhoase (ANC) asked how far the Department is on issues of internal controls<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Kok stated there are three areas that need to be tightened. The leadership has to have policies in place; financial management measures; and procurement systems in order to comply. This is the framework set by National Treasury. So, all three areas have to comply.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr C Maxegwana (ANC) asked whether lessons were learnt from other countries seeing that employment in agriculture is on the decline. What was the Department not doing in its assessments of grants because so much under spending is reported and the blame is put on poor planning by provinces? What can be done to make sure co-operatives are viable?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Mabugu, Research Director: FFC, regarding declining employment in agriculture, elaborated there are various case studies on this issue from different countries. Interventions implemented yielded different outcomes. These case studies point out that it is important to focus on the situation of your own country and devise solutions that are relevant to your own problems. Pertaining to grant assessments, he indicated there is no reason why the Department could not get information from provinces and exercise monitoring and evaluation on the game plans of the provinces.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProfessor Steytler, concerning the viability of co-operatives, enlightened the Members that South Africa has a dual agricultural sector: commercial farming and emerging farming. The co-operatives are very important to bring individuals to participate in the sector. Studies conducted pointed out that decision-making powers of individuals in the co-operatives play a role and need to be approved. Sometimes individuals are not given powers for decision-making. This hampers the work of the co-operative. Communication between members needs to be improved because, sometimes, members are far away from the land they are working on and Board Members.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDAFF Presentation on Strategic and Annual Performance Plan and APAP<br />\r\nMs Steyn asked whether there was communication between the Department and the Competition Commission. She remarked there is no direct link between the APAP and Strategic Plan, and it would be better if the two could be combined. She saw stronger linkages between DAFF and the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform (DRDLR) especially on issues of commonality like de-bushing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProfessor Vries, regarding the Competition Commission, informed the Committee that discussions were held with the Commission so that certain things could be brought to the attention of the Department, especially things related to procurement of vaccines. The Competition Commission is a partner of the Department and it assists and provides advice when called upon.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Hlatshwayo, on linkages between DAFF and DRDLR, said the two departments have discussed a funding model agreement. According to the agreement, if DRDLR gets a piece of land, then DAFF would have to come up with a production input.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Z Jongbloed (DA) asked if or when the Department is going to hand over to communities the commercially viable forestry land it is said to be sitting on; and also for clarity on the hectares under irrigation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Dennis Molaba, Chief Director: DAFF, reported that the land in question falls under Category B and C plantation. It is still under government control and is being processed by land requisite and land tenure rights. The Department is guided by DRDLR, which is facilitating the process.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConcerning hectares under irrigation, the National Development Plan expects 500 000 hectares, but the research of the Department indicates the availability of 30 000 hectares.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Ramokhoase asked what kind of research the FFC is doing; and if the Department is going to have money to train co-operatives if its budget keeps on decreasing because there is a big budget gap between the Strategic Plan and the APAP. He further remarked that the Department forgot to mention and expand on pronouncements like AgriParks, as this would help those doing oversight to check the commodities happening in specific areas.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProfessor Vries, pertaining to research, indicated that it is sound and would be presented in the strategic workshop that would be held soon. It is available. Marine research is getting recognition the entire world over and is being peer reviewed. With regard to training of co-operatives, the budget would come from the Department of Small Business Development (DSBD), but the target is that of the Department. The project is going to be done through the DSBD and would be put in the APAP plans. On the issue of AgriParks, the Department would assist the DRDLR as to where the AgriParks would be.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Maxegwana remarked that the documents that guide us are developed by people and are about the experiences of communities. For example, the APAP process had some elements of things to be done, but it does not state the inputs of some stakeholders during the consultative process. The Fruit Industry Value Chain sector has not transformed, and in the mid-term it has to see transformation, not much has been said of it during the presentation. He further wanted to know the beneficiaries of the Forestry sector, and asked for clarity on the integrated funding model for APAP.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Molaba, on beneficiaries, said they have been advised to employ the local youth and women.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Hlatshwayo said the Department has consulted widely on the integrated funding model. Even the private sector was involved. According to this fund, money is put in a central pot. The model then states what is to be funded and not funded, and it even indicates the amount to be allocated.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson asked if aquaculture had a budget.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Hlatshwayo reported there is no budget for it. The Department engaged with National Treasury about it for the past two years and there has been no positive response from National Treasury.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProfessor Vries, responding to the concerns of Members about the budget cuts and projection costs for the implementation of the Strategic Plans and APAP, made it clear that no money has been allocated for APAP. Things are going to be aligned in order to achieve some of the targets set. The Department is not going to be able to have all the projects happening in one year, but it is important to have a focus and target one thing at a time and make sure it is done correctly. This is going to need a paradigm shift, and people should start thinking of doing things differently.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Hlatshwayo also noted that most of the money of the Department is not centred on administration. The bulk of the money gets transferred to other activities of the Department. The Department is experiencing budget cuts but it has not underspent. For the past three years, it has spent 98% of its budget.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProfessor Vries concurred with Hlatshwayo by stating that CASP money taken from Ilima/Letsema has been spread all over to execute some of the activities to be done for people. The CASP money has been directed towards APAP.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Bheki Cele, Deputy Minister: DAFF, agreed with Prof Vries saying all the MECs, DDGs and Chief Directors of DAFF, nationally and provincially, were told no money was going to be available for agriculture. There was no discussion on what could be done. So, the Department had to do with what it has; yet during the State of the Nation Address agriculture had a big mention. He hoped the Ministers and DGs of DAFF and DSBD would work together to ensure that co-operatives get the necessary training. But without money, nothing is going to be achieved.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson said she was under the impression that the Department did not present a convincing and realistic budget to National Treasury. The Department has to present what it needs to do against what it has got in terms of money. She exemplified by saying if the Department has to cultivate 9000 hectares of land and it only has R100, one hectare has to be cultivated at a cost of R100. It is better that it works that way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMLRF Presentation<br />\r\nMr Mortimer Mannya, Director-General on Fisheries: DAFF, mentioned that over the next medium term, the Fisheries sector would focus on some key strategic priorities, including: implementation of aquaculture catalyst projects as part of the Operation Phakisa initiative; conducting of research into genetics and nutrition for selected aquaculture species; expediting the allocation of fishing rights to registered small-scale fishing co-operatives to alleviate poverty, promote food security, and equitable access and sustainable utilisation; development of recovery plans to address depletion of fish stocks challenges for three of the four prioritised stocks (abalone, rock lobster, line fish and hake); and conducting research and compiling reports on the status of fish stock levels.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRegarding issues of risk management, the inability to carry out core fisheries functions and mandates and ability to meet predetermined objectives would be mitigated through the formulation of a plan to improve efficiency of revenue collection; realistic planning and target setting; revisiting strategic plan; and investigating potential additional sources of revenue.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInadequate ICT systems and aging technology would be remedied through developing appropriate policies including an infrastructure plan and electronic data management system, while inadequate supply chain management processes would be mitigated through further training for supply chain management practitioners and developing enterprise procurement plan.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInsufficient human resources and appropriate skills in key positions would be resolved through coordination with Corporate Services Branches and the CFO, and MLRF would adopt applicable human resource policies. Insufficient budget to cover personnel and operational requirements would be mitigated through business case motivations to the National Treasury and DAFF, and efforts would be increased to collect all sources of revenue.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAmidst limited financial resources, the Fisheries Branch would devote its resources towards achieving the Strategic Objectives over the medium term through following innovative and efficient mechanisms. Focused spending would be on performing enforcement and compliance operations in prioritised fisheries sectors.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEfforts and resources would be synchronised strategically to avoid silos, duplication and wasteful expenditure. Jobs would be created in the coastal and rural communities so as to broaden the scope of the aquaculture sector. This would serve as a catalyst towards sustainable growth and food security.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe major expenditure elements of fisheries are under the direct control and administration of the MLRF and are expected to increase over the MTEF. Most expenditure would be on the vessels for patrol and research, and there would be an increase in the Extended Public Works Programme and Working For Fisheries Projects. These areas would be funded through the collection of own revenue and transfers received from DAFF.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor the 2015/16 period, the Fisheries Branch has supported four Operation Phakisa projects for phase 1. It plans, amongst other things, to conduct two new research studies on genetics and nutrition for aquaculture species; allocate rights to registered small-scale fisheries co-operatives; implement recovery plans for abalone, hake, rock lobster and deep water hake; and carry out 4548 compliance and enforcement measures in the four prioritised fisheries sectors &ndash; hake, abalone, rock lobster and line fish.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n(Graphs and tables were shown to illustrate revenue projected and expenditure allocations over the MTEF periods)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em><strong>NAMC Presentation</strong></em><br />\r\nMr Tshililo Ramabulana, Chief Executive Officer: NAMC, informed the Committee that NAMC operates within a dynamic environment characterised by a number of local and global socio-economic and policy challenges such as the shortcomings of land reform, market dominance by some role-players along the agro-food chain, lack of effective collaboration between government and the private sector, and proliferation of food safety standards and regulations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, there are some opportunities that could be exploited. The opportunities are around the stable production of raw material which provide a competitive and stable supply chain, development and growth over a large geographical area provides a more stable way for long term growth of the country, and well positioned agricultural sector to advance exports.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRegarding statutory measures, during the 2013 financial year a sum of R450 million was collected. Twenty industries are administering statutory measures relating to registrations, records and returns. Research is contributing 29%. GFADA forks out 22% towards transformation. For export promotion, WOSA pays 17%. 12% and 8% from SAGIS and SAWIS go to information and local promotion, respectively.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe statutory measure ensures that transformation activities of the Industry Organisations are aligned with government policy; that spending is in line with Transformation Guidelines; and R83.7 million of statutory funds is used for transformation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Markets and Economic Research Centre (MERC) within NAMC gauges the efficiency of the market for every agricultural commodity; it undertakes market and trade research to inform interventions aimed at enhancing the viability of agro-food; and intensifies research efforts on options to link smallholder farmers to the agro-food value chain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Strategic Integrated Project (SIP) 11 is said to assist project owners to strengthen the project business cases to raise funding and to coordinate reporting on existing and proposed new high-impact / anchor agro-logistics and rural infrastructure projects. Current focus is on the mobilisation of funding for many of the anchor projects. Currently, only R3 billion has been secured.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Agricultural Information Management System (AIMS) offers accurate and verifiable baseline information required for business, production, resource conservation and marketing for practitioners, farmers and decision makers. The NAMC has been appointed to coordinate the national rollout of AIMS.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Agribusiness Development division of NAMC boasts of having development schemes which are driven to address food security and domestic market access. This division is made up of seven development schemes:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVineyard development scheme: facilitated with Winetech and the Northern Cape Department of Agriculture<br />\r\nGrain development scheme: facilitated with GFADA and grain trusts<br />\r\nDairy development scheme: facilitated with Milk South Africa and Free State Department of Agriculture<br />\r\nLucerne development scheme: facilitated with NLT<br />\r\nMohair development scheme: facilitated with Mohair Development Trust<br />\r\nSunflower development scheme: facilitated with Oil Seed Trust and Limpopo Department of Agriculture<br />\r\nRed meat scheme: facilitated with DAFF (CASP), district municipalities and DRDLR, and sells 3000 animals per cycle<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Agribusiness division provides training and mentorship programme aimed at emerging agribusiness entrepreneurs, and is driven by the need for human capital development in agriculture in order to meet the goals of South Africa and to redress past imbalances. It collaborates with Mzinti and Madzivhandila Agricultural Colleges and other non-governmental organisations. It also provides management training for women in agribusiness.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPertaining to the Agricultural Trusts, NAMC attends to all industry trust board meetings; facilitates the appointment of Trustees; and produces the Status Report on Agricultural Industry Trusts. From 2015/16, NAMC would also track job creation by various industry trusts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Ramabulana reported the entity has been allocated R34.63 million. The transfer indicates a nominal decrease of R1.37 million as compared to the 2014/15 financial-year. Almost 82% of the transfer is allocated to Administration and Markets and Economic Research Centre.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n(Graphs and tables were shown to illustrate performance indicators and MTEF budget allocation)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPPECB Presentation<br />\r\nMr Cyril Julius, Acting Chief Executive Officer: PPECB, made it clear to Members the spending focus over the medium term would be on continued service delivery without compromising the integrity of product quality and continued contribution towards social responsibility in building capacity and assisting small farmers as well as focusing on establishing a professional and well trained staff compliment that could add value to the perishable export industry.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe 2015/16 budget is informed by four main drivers: delivery of statutory services; execution of the Board approved strategic plan; mitigation of the main risk areas in the service delivery of PPECB priorities; and moving towards electronic export certification.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom 2014/15, expenditure is set to increase for the next five years by an average annual rate of 10.4% to R424 million in 2019/20. It is assumed that the activity base used in 2015/16 would track the growth in exports. The activity base refers to the operational resources deployed, kilometres travelled and relief duty days. There was an increase of an average of 12% in computer expenses due to the introduction of mobile technology.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOver the three-year MTEF period, it is expected that personnel expenditure would increase by an average of 11.4% per annum to R235.5 million in 2017/18. Salaries including promotions are adjusted by an average of 6% per annum. The period ending 2019/20 would continue to address human resource constraints to ensure the entity meets its mandate and strategic goals. Employment costs of R172 million in 2015/16 are set to increase to R283 million over the next five years. 67% of total expenditure is made of personnel costs. The vacancy rate is kept at 6% of total staff over the five-year period.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOver the three-year MTEF period, it is expected that expenditure would increase by an average of 11.9% per annum to R353.9 million in 2017/18. It is assumed the activity base used in 2015/16 would track the growth in exports. The expenditure is adjusted by 5% per annum with the exception of accommodation, airfares, fuel and employment costs which are adjusted by between 8% and 10% per annum to accommodate growth in export volumes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is assumed the total income would increase by 9.4% over the MTEF. The 9.4% increase is based on 6% inflationary adjustment to the levies and a 3% growth in product volumes inspected. A 3% growth is assumed for all the other products and services. It is also projected that the laboratory would generate an income of between R12 million and R15 million per year.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOver the medium term, the entity is committed to achieve, amongst others, the following outcomes:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFormulate and submit a PPECB strategy aligned with the Government imperatives and stakeholder expectations<br />\r\nObtain ISO 9001:2008 certification and level 4 BBBEE verification<br />\r\n&nbsp;Migrating from a manual to an automated inspection system<br />\r\nIntroduce systems and processes that promote sound financial and governance practices without hampering business efficiency.<br />\r\n&nbsp;Increase spend on Corporate Social Initiatives<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe organisation has in the past eight years offered a learnership at NQF level 5, which exposes learners to the post-harvest agricultural value chain and provides them with a head start in advancing themselves professionally in this sector. The entity aims to continue with this initiative and would like to partner with the likes of CPUT to assist in enhancing the qualification the students obtain at PPECB. The programme is provided in partnership with DAFF and Agri-Seta.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally, Mr Julius said the organisation is putting a lot of emphasis in the area of capacity building. It provides development opportunities for both internal and external stakeholders. The focus, internally, is on youth and women. Leadership Development initiatives are being put in place to ensure women are accelerated so that they could assume leadership roles as these are occupied by males. The entity has introduced a Learning Management System with on-line on-boarding. The focus is on coaching and mentoring to ensure the youth entering the workplace are empowered to be able to provide customer service with confidence. The organisation also has a dedicated programme for ensuring uniform interpretation and consistent application of standards during the execution of product inspection, cold chain functions and food safety audits.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n(Graphs and tables were shown to illustrate performance indicators and MTEF budget allocation)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Discussion</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><em>Marine Living Resources Presentation</em></strong><br />\r\nMs Jongbloed proposed that the consultation process on small-scale fisheries should be extended because people on the ground are not fully aware of the programme and there seems to be problems with co-operatives. She enquired what is going to happen to small-scale fisheries inland; and asked for clarity on the recovery plans for rock lobster, abalone, and hake and line fish.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Mannya, on inland fisheries, indicated that aquaculture has two streams: marine aquaculture and inland aquaculture. The Department is developing a policy for inland fisheries, and this area is regulated by the Department of Water and Sanitation. With regard to recovery plans, the Fisheries section of the Department always monitors the status of the various species and has plans for each and every species.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr M Filtane (UDM) asked whether Fisheries is going to draw the business plans for the co-operatives or if it would receive them for implementation; and how Fisheries is planning to overcome the problem around accessing of the markets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Mannya, regarding business plans, explained that the Department of Small Business Development would provide business management plans, and Fisheries would train the co-operatives. Concerning access to markets, there are clear indications of how the branch of DAFF that deals with marketing would go about dealing with the matter.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNAMC Presentation<br />\r\nMr Filtane asked what would be the anticipated negative impact of the 36% budget cut in professional services.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Ramabulana stated that 60% of the work or research is done internally. 40% is outsourced to create centres of excellence so a lot of work could be done much cheaper; it is not possible to have internal capacity all the time. It also made sure people who make use of NAMC resources do comply.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Ramokhoase wanted to find out about the participants in the dairy development schemes; and he asked for clarity on the levies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Ramabulana said the dairy scheme is located in Qwaqwa. The farmers on the scheme are still at a primary stage and need to be helped in order to benefit from the value chain. On levies, 20% goes to transformation rather than the 20% of the R36 million budget. The Act allows farmers to collect a certain portion of money to fund public good.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Maxegwana enquired if the DAFF budget cut had an impact on the NAMC budget; and asked what percentage of the budget goes to consultants, if the entity is using of them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Ramabulana explained that it did have an impact because the entity had to cut down on travelling costs, consultancy fees, and it relies mostly on internal capacity. Around R250 000 per annum goes to consultants.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson wanted to establish where the red meat scheme is happening; and asked if the norms and standards document has been implemented or is being implemented.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Ramabulana responded that the red meat scheme started in the Eastern Cape because the province has the highest number of livestock. Other facilities are being supported at Kuruman in the Northern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. The average price of the 3000 animals sold per cycle is R5000. The NAMC is providing a platform for small farmers to access the markets. The Committee would be sent detailed information of where the schemes are. On norms and standards, the work has just been completed and it is still to be processed and approved by DAFF.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPPECB Presentation<br />\r\nMs Jongbloed asked what the vacancy rate of the entity is.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Julius replied that it is less than 6%.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Maxegwana enquired if the entity is able to track down students and farmers that have graduated so that they could plough back to the organisation, but at a different level.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Julius stated that poaching is an issue they grapple with because people go to other companies or organisations. They do help smallholders but they are still at a primary stage and struggle with things like water.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Filtane remarked that the presentation was difficult to follow. The presentation was scanty and badly delivered. He was interested to know if the entity collaborates with similar organisations in other countries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Julius replied that they do attend international forums, but the organisation expends its energies on making audits on goods leaving the country.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson enquired if the entity is able to assist its members or clients with research.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Julius reported the industry has its own research bodies such as Citrus Research. The only thing the entity does is to hold trials on new products.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson remarked that the organisation should consider looking at the quality so that when it is processed for export it is at another level, even if it means the introduction of a levy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe meeting was adjourned.</p>\r\n",

        "summary": "<p>In its presentation of strategic and annual performance plans, the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries indicated that the Agricultural Policy Action Plan is a replacement agriculture strategy that comprises sectoral key action programmes and provides a long-term vision and focused interventions in a five-year rolling schedule.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Portfolio Committee on Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries also heard of key issues affecting the agricultural sector. Thousands of hectares of under-utilised arable land in the former homelands are posing a challenge. The land in these communal areas would be put into production with focused support for input access, technical support and linkages to local markets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the main limitations with fisheries is that catch volumes depend on fish stocks that vary naturally and are subject to depletion owing to over-exploitation. Inshore species tend to be in a state of stock depletion. This leads to an increase in illegal fishing and poaching and is increasing the demand for access to finite marine resources.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe challenge of growing the smallholder sector is closely tied up with the challenge of making smallholder agriculture more remunerative. Currently, more than half of all smallholder households live below the poverty line. Market access for developing producers has also been identified as one of the key challenges for the Department.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is a decline in both softwood and hardwood plantation areas planted since the mid 1990s, and there has been an increase in the area for pulpwood purposes compared to the area for saw logs and mining timber. Shortages of timber products have been recorded.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) further enlightened the Committee that the purpose of the sectoral and transversal key action programme for Agricultural Policy Action Plan (PAP) is to begin to address the growing concentration within the market which impacts on job creation and seeks to localise food networks through infrastructure development and incentivising support for SMMEs and small-scale producers across agriculture, forestry and fisheries value chain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCriteria for the selection of role players in the sector focused on contribution to food security, job creation, and growth potential, and potential contribution to trade balance. Some of the role players the presentation focused on for priority value chains and transversal action programmes include: red meat, poultry, wheat, forestry, and fisheries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Auditor-General of South Africa (AGSA) centred its presentation of the annual performance plans of the Department for 2015/16 on three programmes:&nbsp; Food Security and Agrarian Reform, Forestry and Natural Resource Management, and Fisheries: Marine Living Resource Fund. The budget for the 2015/16 period was also presented.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn Food Security and Agrarian Reform, the AG found that 13% of targets were not measurable and 13% of indicators were not verifiable. The strategic objective is to lead and coordinate government food security initiatives. A number of hectares of under-utilised land in communal areas have been cultivated for production.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPertaining to Forestry and Natural Resource Management, the AG discovered that 22% of targets were not measurable, and 11% of targets were not specific. 22% of indicators were not verifiable. Against the strategic objective of ensuring the conservation, protection, rehabilitation and recovery of depleted and degraded natural resources, indicators stated that a number of hectares in irrigation schemes have been revitalised.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRegarding Fisheries (Marine Living Resources Fund), the AG pointed out that 11% of targets were not specific and 33% of indicators were not well defined. The strategic objective is to ensure increased production and productivity in prioritised areas as well as value chains. The indicator per the annual performance plan, read in conjunction with the target does not define the type of support that is required in order to achieve the objective.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Financial and Fiscal Commission (FFC) informed the Committee there has been a consistent decline in agricultural employment over time from 1,8 million in 1962 to 764 000 in 2013. This trend has continued with the labour force survey showing nett job losses in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to 2013.The outlook for 2015 is expected to put further upward pressure on food prices with the recent increase in the fuel levy and policy on cost-reflective electricity tariffs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAgricultural conditional grants have experienced a real decline over the MTEF period as a result of under spending, especially with respect to the CASP grant. The main reasons for under spending include poor planning, contractor challenges, late changes to business plans and weak and ineffective procurement processes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Commission recommended that DAFF should strengthen its ability to enforce the conditions in the grant framework to ensure better oversight of provinces so that spending and performance of agricultural conditional grants could be improved.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMembers, on the DAFF presentation, asked if there is communication between the Department and the Competition Commission; wanted to establish if or when the Department is going to hand over to communities the commercially viable forestry land is said to be sitting on; asked if aquaculture had a budget; and asked for clarity on the hectares under irrigation. On the AGSA and FFC presentation, how food security is measured and who the role players are; if any lessons were learnt from other countries seeing that employment in agriculture is on the decline; and what can be done to make sure co-operatives are viable.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Marine Living Resources Fund (MLRF) stated that amidst limited financial resources, the Fisheries Branch would devote its resources towards achieving the strategic objectives over the medium term through following innovative and efficient mechanisms. Focused spending would be on performing enforcement and compliance operations in prioritised fisheries sectors.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe major expenditure elements of fisheries are under the direct control and administration of the MLRF and are expected to increase over the MTEF. Most expenditure would be on the vessels for patrol and research, and there would be an increase in the Extended Public Works Programme and Working For Fisheries Projects. These areas would be funded through the collection of own revenue and transfers received from DAFF.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor the 2015/16 period, the Fisheries Branch has supported four Operation Phakisa projects for phase 1. It plans to conduct two new research studies on genetics and nutrition for aquaculture species; allocate rights to registered small-scale fisheries co-operatives; implement recovery plans for abalone, hake, rock lobster and deep water hake; and carry out 4548 compliance and enforcement measures in the four prioritised fisheries sectors: hake, abalone, rock lobster and line fish.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe National Agricultural Marketing Council (NAMC) operates within a dynamic environment characterised by a number of local and global socio-economic and policy challenges such as the shortcomings of land reform, market dominance by some role-players along the agro-food chain, lack of effective collaboration between the government and the private sector, and proliferation of food safety standards and regulations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Markets and Economic Research Centre (MERC) within NAMC gauges the efficiency of the market for every agricultural commodity, it undertakes market and trade research to inform interventions aimed at enhancing the viability of agro-food, and it intensifies research efforts on options to link smallholder farmers to the agro-food value chain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Agricultural Information Management Systems (AIMS) offers accurate and verifiable baseline information required for business, production, resource conservation and marketing for practitioners, farmers and decision makers. The NAMC has been appointed to coordinate the national rollout of AIMS.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Agribusiness Development division within NAMC provides training and mentorship programme aimed at emerging agribusiness entrepreneurs, and is driven by the need for human capital development in agriculture in order to meet the goals of South Africa and to redress past imbalances. It collaborates with Mzinti and Madzivhandila Agricultural Colleges and other non-governmental organisations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn finances, the entity reported to be allocated R34.63 million. The transfer indicates a nominal decrease of R1. 37 million compared to the 2014/15 financial-year. Almost 82% of the transfer is allocated to Administration and Markets and Economic Research Centre.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Perishable Products Export Control Board (PPECB) made it clear to the Committee that the spending focus over the medium term would be on continued service delivery without compromising the integrity of product quality and continued contribution towards social responsibility in building capacity and assisting small farmers as well as focusing on establishing a professional and well trained staff compliment that could add value to the perishable export industry.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOver the three-year MTEF period, it is expected that personnel expenditure would increase by an average of 11.4% per annum to R235.5 million in 2017/18. Salaries, including promotions, are adjusted by an average of 6% per annum.

These bills are considered by the National Assembly&#39;s Standing Committee on Private Member&#39;s Legislative Proposals and Special Petitions. If the Committee agrees with the principle of the draft Bill, a Bill will be prepared and dealt with by Parliament.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe National Council of Provinces Select Committee on Members&#39; and Provincial Legislative Proposals considers draft Bills from individual NCOP members and provincial legislatures.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPetitions may also be tabled in Parliament and referred to the relevant committee that deals with the issue raised in the petition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Internal Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Assembly has a number of internal committees that deal with matters affecting the running of Parliament. The Committees normally consist of senior Members of Parliament. The Rules Committee and its sub-committees deal with House rules, the budget of the House, support for Members, internal arrangements, and powers and privileges of members. Other internal Committees are the Programme Committee that plans the work of the Assembly, the Disciplinary Committee, and the Committee of Chairpersons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe National Council of Provinces has its own domestic Committees. The Rules Committee and its subcommittees deal with the NCOP rules, the NCOP budget, parliamentary privileges, internal arrangements, international relations and delegated legislation. The Programme Committee plans the work of the NCOP and the Committee of Chairpersons make recommendations about the functioning of Committees and other NCOP forums.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Ad hoc Committees</strong><br />\r\nParliament or one of its Houses may appoint an ad hoc (temporary) Committee when a special task must be done. When the task is complete, the Committee is dissolved.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Joint Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces together appoint a number of joint committees, for example the Constitutional Review Committee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and the Joint Standing Committee on Defence are statutory Committees. This means that they are established, by the Constitution or by an Act of Parliament, as well as in terms of the rules of Parliament.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe committees play a very important role in the process of building democracy and involving the public in the processes and activities of Parliament.</p>\r\n",

        "body": "<p><strong>Small-Scale Fisheries Policy</strong><br />\r\nMr Mortimer Mannya, Deputy Director-General on Fisheries, DAFF, informed the Committee the implementation that the Small-Scale Fisheries Policy commenced with the launch of the Small-Scale Fisheries Forum, the gazetting of the draft Regulations for Public Comment and the call for Expressions of Interest &ndash; all of which took place on 27 February 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Small-Scale Fisheries Policy (SSFP) was adopted in 2012 and its Implementation Plan was approved in 2013. One of the key milestone dates was the allocation of small-scale fishing rights in December 2013, and then it was revised in June 2014. The Roll-out Plan was developed in April 2014 and was presented at various structures within the Department.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe new rollout plan aims to implement the Small-Scale Fisheries Policy over a five-year period and also identifies roles and responsibilities and key dependencies required to implement the Small-Scale Fisheries Policy. The high point of the rollout plan is the allocation of small-scale fishing rights in March 2016. The process consists of five phases.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPhase 1: Preparatory Phase<br />\r\nThis phase lays a firm foundation in order to embark on the process of implementing the Small-Scale Fisheries Policy. The activities in this phase, amongst others, include:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBudget and business planning<br />\r\nApproval of a new roll-out plan for the implementation of SSFP<br />\r\nEstablishment of a Steering Committee<br />\r\nDissemination of the new roll-out plan<br />\r\nEstablishment of the Small-Scale Fisheries Forum<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo date, the implementation of the SSFP is included as a strategic goal for DAFF over the medium term (2014/15 &ndash; 2018/19). Funds from the Marine Living Resources Fund were made available for the start of the implementation process for 2014/15. The Small-Scale Fisheries Steering Committee was established in 2014 and meetings are convened monthly. The Small-Scale Fisheries Forum was launched on 27 February 2015. The Final Regulations and Marine Living Resources Act Amendment Act is to be promulgated on May 2015. The Minister has approved the publishing of draft regulations for public comment and was gazetted on 27 February 2015. The Director-General approved the bid process to appoint service providers for the rollout plan. The Bid Adjudicating Committee approved the recommendation to appoint two service providers and a Service Level Agreement is to be signed during March 2015.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPhase 2: Development of Support Plans<br />\r\nThis phase requires that a number of support plans be developed and implemented so as to enhance the implementation process of the SSFP. Key plans, amongst others, include:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSector management measures<br />\r\nCo-operative model<br />\r\nCo-operative constitution template<br />\r\nCo-operative management plan template<br />\r\nCommunication plan<br />\r\nStakeholder engagement plan<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSector management measures have been drafted. Co-operative models have been investigated with input from selected communities. The co-operative constitution template has been developed with assistance from the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). The communication and stakeholder engagement plans have been discussed at Steering Committee meetings. The revenue management plan has been developed with assistance from the DTI and Co-operatives and Rural Economic Development (DAFF).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPhase 3: Formalisation of small-scale fishing communities into co-operatives<br />\r\nThis phase is the most critical one for the successful allocation of small-scale fishing rights because it is in this phase where all <em>bona fide </em>small-scale fishers have to be identified, verified and registered into small-scale fishing communities. This phase includes the following activities:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRegistration of expression of interest per community<br />\r\nVerification of fishers and identification of small-scale fishing communities<br />\r\nConducting socio-economic baseline study of the entire sector<br />\r\nConducting alternative livelihoods study per area<br />\r\nRegistration of small-scale fishing communities as co-operatives<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPhase 4: Allocation of fishing rights to small-scale fisheries co-operatives<br />\r\nThis phase is the pinnacle of the implementation of the small-scale fisheries policy as this would be the official start of the small-scale fisheries sector when the fishing rights are allocated to small-scale fishing co-operatives in March 2016. Activities include:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nApproval of registered co-operatives as small-scale fisheries co-operatives by the Minister<br />\r\nBusiness training of all co-operative board members<br />\r\nAllocation of fishing rights<br />\r\nIssuing of permits<br />\r\nFinalisation of appeals<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPhase 5: Management and support of small-scale fisheries co-operatives<br />\r\nThis is the last phase of the implementation and requires three years of providing developmental support to the small-scale fishing co-operatives. This phase is required to ensure economic development and long-term success of the co-operatives. Key activities include:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFacilitation of developmental programmes per co-operative in partnership with other organisations<br />\r\nMeetings of co-management structures<br />\r\nRoutine management of the sector<br />\r\nImplementation and refinement of monitoring control and surveillance and catch monitoring plans<br />\r\nReview success of implementation by conducting another socio-economic study and comparing to baseline study<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFRAP 2013 and 2015<br />\r\nMr Mannya informed Members that the previous Minister set aside FRAP 2013 and instituted an audit by Harris, Nupen and Molebatsi Attorneys in February 2014. The process was found to have been controversial, rotten with allegations and perceptions of irregularities, manipulation, and unlawful decision-making and un-procedural conduct.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSubsequent to FRAP 2013, the Emang Basadi Legal and Forensic Services was appointed to conduct a review and assessment of the capacity and work processes in the department, including line and support functions, business processes, and external support required to ensure that the Department is prepared and has the necessary capacity to commence and finalise the fishing rights allocation processes (corrective actions of FRAP 2013 and FRAP 2015/16).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe findings on FRAP 2013 pointed to a political apathy and lack of leadership from national government; clarity of policies and governance structure; and numerous operational gaps including lack of proper planning and insufficient good business processes. It was also found that the General Policy and Sector Specific Policies have not been reviewed; and the R20 million allocated for the rights allocation was insufficient.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Harris Report made recommendations, which the Emang Basadi validated. Since the setting aside of FRAP 2013, the Department has not dealt with the appeals or the review of the allocations. The Emang Basadi recommended the Minister to appoint an independent Appeals Board led by a senior attorney or advocate to deal with the backlog of FRAP 2013.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFRAP 2015 and processes<br />\r\nIn preparation for the Fishing Rights Allocation Process, the Department would embark on a Policy Review and Public Participation Process that would result in the publication of 9 Fisheries Sector Specific Policies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo successfully deliver the credible Fishing Rights Allocation Process, the recommendation by Emang Basadi was that the Minister should in terms of section 18 6A (a) of the MLRA exempt current right holders in order to extend their rights for a period of 12 months while the Department puts in place credible processes for allocations. Fishing rights in some of the fishing sectors are going to expire between 28 February and 31 December 2015.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Mannya emphasised that adequate human resources is critical for the successful delivery of FRAP. Though the Fishing Rights Allocation Process is the Fisheries Branch mandate, it is, however, the core function of the Chief Directorate on Marine Resources Management. FRAP is said to be contributing significantly to the revenue of the Fisheries Branch. The Chief Directorate on Marine Resources Management is expected to commit dedicated officials for the successful implementation of FRAP and they would have to &lsquo;vacate&rsquo; their daily duties in order to fully focus on successful implementation of FRAP. This would add a burden on certain officials who would have to ensure that service delivery is not crippled. Over and above FRAP, the Implementation Plan of the Small-Scale Fisheries Policy would run concurrently and it is envisaged that 40 contract workers would be required for a period of 12 to 18 months.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the issue of financial resources, the budget for FRAP 2015/16 would be utilised to pay for services that may be rendered by the service provider to the Department; and it would be used to develop and improve systems that are credible for rights allocations. The funds are needed for processes such as gazetting, legal services, vetting, public consultations, printing of application forms and sector policies in four coastal languages, distribution and receipting of application forms, and manning of the FRAP call centre and general communication. It is envisaged that overtime may exceed 30% limit of the basic salary of employees. In order to meet the tight deadlines, it is envisioned that overtime would be necessary. The estimated budget based on the Project Plan is R45 million against a current deficit of R16 million.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally, the targets set for FRAP 2015 include the review and revision of the nine sector specific policies; development of application forms and schedules for nine fishing sectors; finalisation of the sector specific policies and application forms; and receipt of appeals in the nine fishing sectors.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>(The Committee was taken through a visual slide presentation on the status of the research vessels)</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em><strong>Discussion</strong></em><br />\r\nRoll-out Plan Presentation<br />\r\nMr T Ramokhoase (ANC) asked for clarity on the composition of the Small-Scale Fisheries Steering Committee, and what languages are going to be used in the dissemination of information.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Mannya replied that the committee comes from the Department and draws from various components of the fisheries sector and communities. On languages, documents are going to be in isiXhosa, isiZulu, Afrikaans and English because those are the languages of the coastal communities. Already, stakeholder engagements and road shows have been started in coastal provinces and information has been communicated in media including printed messages to inform community representatives and traditional leaders in order to take ownership of the project.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr P Mabe (ANC) asked about the role the Small-Scale Fisheries Forum would play and if it would allow the fishers to get their stock to the markets. He also suggested the documents of the policy be not translated into the languages of the coastal areas only, and enquired about measures that would be taken to ensure the understanding of the Small-Scale Fisheries Policy is widely known even in inland areas.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Mannya explained the Department would continue to engage with the forum and that the forum is an advisory body, not a decision making body. On taking the policy inland, he indicated the Department has noted the language concern and would consider taking it further to a national level in its efforts to make the public aware of the policy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr C Maxegwana (ANC) commented that the small-scale fisheries sector is a game-changer in the economy of the country especially if it is done correctly and there would be many changes in the lives of ordinary people staying in these coastal towns. Co-operatives in these coastal towns, especially rural ones, are going to need a thorough training in order to participate in the economy and consideration should be taken on the different species available in these different areas.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Mannya acknowledged that the Department is well aware of the fact that training in coastal rural areas is going to double if literacy levels are taken into consideration.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Z Jongbloed (DA) asked how the Department is going to ensure that draft regulations are finalised before the Act comes into force; and how the Department is going to roll out the plan when there are already budget cuts. She enquired about the names of the consultants who would be working on the roll-out and the amount of money allocated to them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Mannya said the Department is working towards finalising the regulations before the Act comes into force but the process is taking its time because the Department wants to ensure there are no uncertainties on fishing and it wants to do things right. Regarding rollout resources and budget cuts, he explained that resources have been taken from the directorates and the Department is going to continue to do with the little it has and it is not going to wait until it has enough money. Concerning consultants, the bidding process has been done but they do not have the names of the successful bidders, the bidders would be contracted over a three-year period.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson then asked if the co-operatives that are going to be established in these coastal towns are going to take into account the presence of youth and women.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Mannya elaborated that with the meagre resources they had, the young and women are encouraged to take part so that they contribute to the economy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs A Steyn (DA) remarked that the policy focuses only on co-operatives and does not create space for individuals who would like to apply for fishing rights.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Mannya explained that they have looked at the feasibility and practicality of dealing with co-operatives. It is impossible and hard to deal with plus minus 7000 individuals, but it is better to deal with a community that is registered as a co-operative. The Department still needs to think thoroughly about the issue of individuals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Jongbloed wanted to know if the Department is giving the communities guidance on basket of species and demarcated areas for fishing to make sure they are not fishing only for the table, but for subsistence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Mannya replied in the affirmative and stated that the Department is also guided by the guidance provided by the communities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Mabe suggested the Minister should consider media partnerships that could be entered into that do not require money in order to disseminate information to the communities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson proposed that the Minister should consider making use of community radio stations in order to communicate directly with the targeted communities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFRAP 2013 and 2015 Presentation<br />\r\nMr Mabe advised the Department to consider making the Appeals Committee a statutory body so as to boost the credibility of the work the Department has been doing and do away with suspicions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Ramokhoase stated that the Department is not saying how it is going to remedy the problem of retiring scarce skills yet it is a very serious matter.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Maxegwana supported Mr Ramokhoase by asking whether there is a plan of succession in place and if there is a presence of young people in the research teams.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Mannya explained that thirty young people were sent to Norway for training on the management services of fisheries. Sixteen of them are still with the Department. He indicated that Namibia and Angola have stopped using consultants. They use internal capacity. Now the Department intends to work with Namibia so that it seconds people to the Department and, in turn, the Department takes two locals to Namibia for upskilling.&nbsp; That is something the Department should be doing on an on-going basis.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Department is spending R3 million on each individual and is prepared to approach Norway again on the matter of training scientists in the management services of fisheries. In addition, young scientists are being mentored, but the money available for the implementation of the succession plan is something the Department should thoroughly think about.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Mabe asked about relations the Department has struck with the institutions of higher learning. He suggested the government should introduce customised courses to make students aware of the fisheries sector, and even consider making use of SETAs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Mannya stated there are three universities the Department has agreements with and that SETAs like AgriSeta would be considered.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs T Gasebonwe-Tongwane asked why the budget cut for research amounted to 60%.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Mannya said the Department has had the same budget every year, but keeps on loading a number of activities. That is why there has been no movement on certain items.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn voiced concern about the timeframes for the policy implementation. She proposed that the time for people to make comments should be extended because it does not seem the Department has time to put critical things into place. The Department should be realistic about timeframes. It should rather take its time on the MLRA to make sure it is doing the right thing. She further suggested that the Appeals Committee be established immediately because there are still outstanding land claims and it is not advisable to open new land claims until the old ones are settled.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Jongbloed wanted to know about the stock status, and the real story of Africana because during the oversight visit they were told Africana would be sailing by the end of February 2015.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Mannya said a report about stock status would be sent to the Committee; and on Africana, information would be furnished once the operational analysis has been received from SAMSA on readiness of Africana to take to the ocean. The vessel is now in East London for repairs and service.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn enquired who is responsible for the research when the vessels are not in motion. She also asked the Department to furnish the Committee with the Smit Amandla and Sekunjalo Reports in order to find out if the recommendations of the Public Protector have been followed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Mannya said the Department is responsible for the research, but SAMSA looks after the vessels. The Smit Amandla and Sekunjalo Reports would be sent to the Committee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Maxegwana asked about the kind of people who are going to be on the Appeals Committee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Mabe stated that the Minister should consider a public nomination process on the people who are going to constitute the Appeals Committee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Mannya said the Department has noted the suggestion that the process should be transparent and be led by a senior advocate and have stakeholder representatives who have knowledge of the industry.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe meeting was adjourned.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Each Committee is headed by a Chairperson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>THE DIFFERENT COMMITTEES OF PARLIAMENT</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Portfolio Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Assembly (NA) appoints from among its members a number of Portfolio Committees to shadow the work of the various national government departments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>The role of Portfolio Committees is to:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>consider Bills, deal with departmental budget votes, oversee the work of the department they are responsible for, and enquire and make recommendations about any aspect of the department, including its structure, functioning and policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe work of Committees is not restricted to government. They may investigate any matter of public interest that falls within their area of responsibility. There is a Portfolio Committee for each national Ministry and its associated government department/s.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Select Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Council of Provinces (NCOP) appoints from its permanent members a number of Select Committees to shadow the work of the various national government departments and to deal with Bills.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause only 54 of the 90 NCOP Members are permanent delegates compared to the 400 of the NA, the Select Committees oversee the work of more than one national government department.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Public Accounts Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Assembly Standing Committee on Public Accounts acts as Parliament&#39;s watchdog over the way taxpayers&#39; money is spent by the Executive. Every year the Auditor-General tables reports on the accounts and financial management of the various government departments and State institutions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHeads of government departments and institutions are regularly called by this committee to report and account for expenditure. The Committee can recommend that the National Assembly takes corrective actions if necessary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Members&#39; Legislative Proposals and Petitions Committees</strong><br />\r\nDraft bills can be submitted by individual Members of the National Assembly. These bills are considered by the National Assembly&#39;s Standing Committee on Private Member&#39;s Legislative Proposals and Special Petitions. If the Committee agrees with the principle of the draft Bill, a Bill will be prepared and dealt with by Parliament.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe National Council of Provinces Select Committee on Members&#39; and Provincial Legislative Proposals considers draft Bills from individual NCOP members and provincial legislatures.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPetitions may also be tabled in Parliament and referred to the relevant committee that deals with the issue raised in the petition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Internal Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Assembly has a number of internal committees that deal with matters affecting the running of Parliament. The Committees normally consist of senior Members of Parliament. The Rules Committee and its sub-committees deal with House rules, the budget of the House, support for Members, internal arrangements, and powers and privileges of members. Other internal Committees are the Programme Committee that plans the work of the Assembly, the Disciplinary Committee, and the Committee of Chairpersons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe National Council of Provinces has its own domestic Committees. The Rules Committee and its subcommittees deal with the NCOP rules, the NCOP budget, parliamentary privileges, internal arrangements, international relations and delegated legislation. The Programme Committee plans the work of the NCOP and the Committee of Chairpersons make recommendations about the functioning of Committees and other NCOP forums.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Ad hoc Committees</strong><br />\r\nParliament or one of its Houses may appoint an ad hoc (temporary) Committee when a special task must be done. When the task is complete, the Committee is dissolved.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Joint Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces together appoint a number of joint committees, for example the Constitutional Review Committee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and the Joint Standing Committee on Defence are statutory Committees. This means that they are established, by the Constitution or by an Act of Parliament, as well as in terms of the rules of Parliament.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe committees play a very important role in the process of building democracy and involving the public in the processes and activities of Parliament.</p>\r\n",

        "body": "<p><strong><em>Chairperson&rsquo;s opening remarks </em></strong><br />\r\nThe Chairperson welcomed everyone to the Committee meeting and indicated that the purpose of the meeting was to hear briefings by the by the National Agricultural Marketing Council (NAMC), South African Poultry Association (SAPA) and Association of Meat Importers and Exporters (AMIE) regarding the challenges that are facing the industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There had been apologies from Nkosi Z Mandela (ANC), Mr B Joseph (EFF), Ms T Tongwana (ANC), Mr T Ramokhoase (ANC) and Ms D Carter (COPE), Mr Senzeni Zokwana, Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and Prof Edith Vries, Director-General (DG) of the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAAF).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Briefing by National Agricultural Marketing Council (NAMC)</strong><br />\r\nMr Tshililo Ramabulana, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), NAMC, indicated that the Agricultural Industry Trusts had come into existence after the closure of former control boards, and the process had started in 1996. The trusts operated under the Marketing of Agricultural Products (MAP) Act (No. 47 of 1996) and had inherited the assets from the former control boards. The Minister had approved the trusts and the deeds of each trust. It was now regarded as an option to retain certain functions related to the industry -- to utilise funds for the purpose they had been collected for. There were currently 26 Ministerial trustees, excluding the South African Wine Industry Trust (SAWIT), and trusts managed in total of over R2 billion worth of assets, mainly financial assets. The NAMC was mandated to manage the communication and reporting processes between the Minister of the DAFF, the Ministerial trustees and industry trusts. It was also responsible to report on annual basis to the Minister of the DAFF through the &quot;Status Report on Agricultural Trusts&quot; on the operations and functioning of the trusts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\nMr Ramabulana said that the appointment of the Ministerial trustees stipulated that a trustee should be a South African citizen, and at least two appointed trustees should preferably be of each gender. The appointees should understand and be able to analyse and interpret financial statements and investments and be knowledgeable and understand the transformation policies of government of the country. The appointees should also possess a desire to advocate for the emerging farmers and the poor, and be sensitive to issues of diversity. The trusts invest funds to various asset managers and disburse the returns to beneficiaries to support industry related functions and activities. They also support transformation initiatives like student bursaries, tree planting projects, communal shearing sheds and corporate social investments. The NAMC had observer status at trusts&rsquo; board meetings and other sub-committees to ensure that there was accountability.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe NAMC was proud about level of transformation in the industry, as there were different trusts that were aimed at historically disadvantaged individuals (HDIs). These included the National Lucerne Trust (NLT) where the Taung project was supporting 20 farmers with 400 hectares. The Potato Industry Development Trust (PlDT) was supporting 16 enterprise development farmers, 55 small growers (food security gardens) and farm base training for farm workers, and the Grain Farmer Development Association (GFADA) supported 53 farmers with 4982 hectares in the Eastern Cape (EC), North West (NW) and Mpumalanga (MP). Grain SA was primarily focused on supporting the training of 3 600 emerging black farmers. 120 emerging farmers are on an advanced farmer project within the development programme. The Wool Trust had allocated R1.85 million for the supply of shearing equipment to 76 communal sheds in the EC and 33 856 quality rams had been distributed. The total amount that had been spent on transformation projects amounted to R505&nbsp;030, and R175 500 had been spent on bursaries and internships.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Ramabulana said that there were various challenges facing trusts that still needed to be addressed, especially in ministerial representation, administration and accountability. The other key additional challenges were on trusts&rsquo; funding and project funding. The main challenges on ministerial representation were mostly related to appointment processes, trusteeship experience and appropriate industry exposure, and the need for a more consultative nomination process. The challenges on administration were linked to autonomy from government, domination by pre-deregulation personalities, and also poor demographic representation and male domination. Under accountability, the main issue was its limitation to beneficiaries (the private sector and members); government intervention was often limited to Trusts Deeds; and ambiguity on how much jurisdiction the government has. The NAMC had also identified challenges on trust funding, especially on those sourced from control boards (transferred to trusts), and the trusts&rsquo; funds were often insufficient to cover administration (transformation, empowerment and land reform).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Ramabulana concluding by stating that the way forward should be about supporting the funding of transformation activities, in line with government policies and strategies and enterprise development throughout the value chain. There should be a concerted effort to support funding of student bursaries, especially targeting the HDIs. The Ministerial trustees needed to meet the Minister of DAFF in order to work together to address some of the challenges and the way forward. The amendment of trust deeds was crucially important, especially where this was necessary to accommodate the current environment. The NAMC should continue to advise trusts for the development of investment strategies to grow their capital assets, and provide capacity building programmes for Ministerial trustees.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Discussion</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr P Mabe (ANC) asked whether there was a strategy in place to address the challenges that had been identified in the trusts. Was there an effort to facilitate and fast-track a legislative process that would assist in the governing of the trusts? It had been indicated in the presentation that trusts managed a total of over R2 billion worth of assets, mainly financial assets. What was the way to ensure that the R2 billion worth of assets would be accounted for? It had been mentioned that the trusts were effectively managed through the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC), the Companies Act and the Trusts Deeds. This was a different terrain, and he could not see how the NAMC, as a public entity could get its &ldquo;hands tied up&rdquo; in the running of a trust which was managed by a Trust Deed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Mabe asked whether there was a way in which the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA) could ensure that the trusts were organised in a way that there was greater accountability. What was the kind of mechanisms that the NAMC was using to ensure that all the trusts across the board were implementing a sound transformative agenda that was supported by the current government? It was indicated that in order for people to benefit from the trusts, they needed to have an understanding of finance, but the understanding of finance and going to school to study finance were two different things. The person who had been running a spaza shop had an understanding of finance, but not to the same extent as a person who was a chartered accountant. Was consideration given to the difference between academic and basic understanding of finance? &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr C Maxegwana (ANC) wanted to know about the process of identifying beneficiaries for bursaries and internships. He had hoped that NAMC would have presented the legal opinion on the government&rsquo;s jurisdiction on trusts&rsquo; assets to the Committee, so it could be noted. What was the way forward to address all the challenges that had been highlighted in the presentation?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs A Steyn (DA) said that she was disappointed that the trustees had not been invited to be part of the meeting, as they could speak for themselves about the challenges that had been experienced in the trusts. Was there any particular reason that the trustees had not been invited?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson responded that the trustees had not been invited because the Committee had decided to firstly hear from NAMC about the progress and challenges in the trusts, and would then invite the trustees to speak for themselves.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\nMr Maxegwana felt that the issue that had been raised by Ms Steyn was inappropriate and irrelevant at the moment, as it was supposed to have been raised internally and not in front of the delegates. It was important for the Committee to work together as a Committee, and not as individuals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson asked whether it was possible for NAMC to provide a breakdown of the money that had been going into research projects, as this was something that the government had not been doing. How much money was going to Research and Development (R&amp;D)? It was important for the Committee to know whether the government was giving away funds to any trusts. The presentation was particularly silent about how the funding was allocated to the trusts. The issue of transformation was critically important, as had been highlighted in the National Development Plan (NDP) and by the Members. However, it was disappointing that there was very little that had been done in terms of transformation in the majority of the trusts. The NAMC had presented a skewed presentation, as there were lot of issues that had been left out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr L Ntshayisa (AIC) wanted to know about the broad requirements of the Ministerial trustees, as this had not been mentioned in the presentation. He asked whether it was possible to get the contacts of people that were located in the Eastern Cape areas, including Flagstaff, Lusikisiki and Mqanduli, who had been given financial assistances, in order to perform oversight on the progress that had been made.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr M Filtane (UDM) asked why the NAMC was reporting on industry trusts on an annual basis instead of quarterly, as this was important to check progress. How were the benefits of the trusts shared? How did people benefit from the trusts? Was there a particular formula according to which the trusts were distributed? Was there enough capacity in place to ensure that the money from the trusts was used efficiently and effectively? It was generally disappointing that some of the trusts &ndash; for example, the Citrus Industry Trust -- had not been complying with transformation guidelines. What were the criteria that had been used to prove that transformation had taken place? How was it possible to link up to every trust that was under the NAMC? How did NAMC ensure that the trusts adhered to the PFMA in terms of capacity and compliance? It was important for NAMC to fast-track the legal opinion process so as to know the government jurisdiction on the trust&rsquo;s agenda.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Maxegwana expressed disappointment that the presentation was particularly silent on the issue of gender equality, and hoped that this matter would be rectified.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson asked whether the guidelines on transformation had been presented and adopted by the trusts, as this was important legislation supported by Parliament. There was no doubt that there was enough money in the country to foster the transformative agenda and improve the lives of the majority of South Africans. What was the direction that had been taken by the trusts to develop the people of South Africa?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Bheki Cele, Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, said that there were many stories that came from individual boards talking about the functioning of the trusts, and it was the responsibility of the Department and the Committee to do oversight to ensure that there was compliance and accountability. He agreed that there was indeed a need to fast-track a legislative process that would assist in the governing of the trusts, especially to ensure that there was a way to account for the R2 billion worth of assets, mainly financial assets. There was often an issue of lack of facilities for female-owned companies, and this needed to be rectified to ensure that there was gender equality.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Ramabulana said that in the past there had been a lack of information regarding what the trustees had been providing to the trusts, since there was no status report on the agricultural trusts. The better part of the presentation had touched on the issue of transformation, as this was important legislation that had been supported by the NDP and Parliament. Most of the Trust Deeds had been developed prior 1996, and this meant they had failed to include the issues related to transformation. He wanted to correct the misconception that the introduction of legislation would ensure that the money from the trusts would be accounted for, as some of the trusts wanted to spend the money, but if they spent it on issues that had not been reflected in the Trust Deeds, then they would be required to pay tax.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Ramabulana reiterated that the presentation was precisely meant to give more information about the issue of transformation within the trusts. The NAMC had provided information to DAFF regarding the legal opinion and there was already a legal team that was drafting a new MAP Act. He hoped that this Act would be tabled to the Minister and the Deputy Minister of DAFF, and then reached the Committee for debates and deliberations. The information that was in the presentation was coming directly from the status report on the agricultural trusts, and each and every trust administrator had been mandated to write a section on their own trust and then send it to NAMC, and the information had been compiled without any verification. The NAMC would develop a document to be sent to the trusts to confirm whether the information that had been compiled was a true reflection or not.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe issue of a legislative review had been raised before. The process of developing a new Marketing Act had been going on for a while, and this issue would be addressed by the Ministry and DAFF. At the moment, the government was not providing any assistance in terms of funding to the trusts, as the funding that had been coming from government was merged with funding available from agricultural trusts for the projects. It was important to highlight that the agreement, when the trust was set up, was that they should invest the capital and live off the interest, therefore the capital that had been provided in the first place was the part that had been growing. Some of the trusts had been growing very well because their investment strategy had been good -- with the right funding managers and assets, some had managed to earn better returns compared to others. Some of the trusts were just generally small and this meant it was always difficult to grow their assets and do something meaningful. The assets of the CIT were very small, but the amount of money that had been collected through levies from the Citrus Growers&rsquo; Association (CGA) was much higher, meaning the research component that had gone into Citrus Black Spot (CBS) had been done using levy money, rather than the trust&rsquo;s money.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Ramabulana said guidelines had been developed regarding transformation and had been approved by the Minister and in line with the Agri-BEE, and each and every industry that had been collecting levies needed to comply with those guidelines. The NAMC had been working closely with the trusts to guide and assist them to adopt those transformation guidelines, but it was always difficult to enforce them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Zamikhaya Xalisa, Senior Manager: Agri-Trust Division, NAMC, indicated that when he had come on to the board, there had been huge resistance to change and transformation and the meetings were often done in Afrikaans instead of English. There was a need for legislative power that would enforce transformation in the industry. In the past, bursaries were often given to students that were enrolled in former &ldquo;white universities,&rdquo; like the University of Stellenbosch (USB) and University of Free State (UFS). Things had been changing, as most of beneficiaries for bursaries and internships were now from the former &ldquo;black universities,&rdquo; like the University of Fort Hare (UFH). There were members who had been participating in the Bursary Working Committee so as to raise awareness about the bursaries that were available at particular universities. The criterion that had been used to choose the beneficiaries of bursaries was normally based on overall student performance at school or university.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Xalisa said that the trusts were not giving any financial assistance to individuals, but was giving the money to the Mohair Empowerment Trust as a beneficiary, and then the Trust would be the one to identify the projects and the needs and support it in terms of buying from the best breeders in order to support well trained smallholder farmers. This was one of the strategies to develop smallholder farmers into becoming commercial farmers. The NAMC had developed some guidelines on the appointment of the Ministerial trustees so as to make the process fair possible to reach where the farmers are, and this process also involved other community members. The NAMC chose the Ministerial trustees based on academic performance or standards, and understanding of both the industry and financial management. These guidelines were crucially important to ensure that the responsibility for allocating funds had been given to the people who understood the government policies and could handle the finances properly and efficiently. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Ramabulana said that the NAMC had established two trusts. These were not industry trusts and had been established because it was difficult to change the Trust Deeds of the existing industry trusts, and therefore it was a big challenge for those trusts to foster transformation. In essence, the two trusts were basically not functioning but had been created as a vehicle to facilitate transformation. He promised that the Members would be provided with a breakdown of the trusts&rsquo; funds in a written response.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Xalisa said that each of the Trust Deeds provided a composition of each trust, and therefore the trustees that had been appointed by each trust were determined by the Trust Deeds. The NAMC had been doing a lot of work with the municipalities to raise awareness about the funds that had been available from the trusts, and some of the big beneficiaries today had been reached through to the presentations and awareness programmes that had been done by NAMC.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Briefing by South African Poultry Association (SAPA) </strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Kevin Lovell, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), SAPA, indicated that the poultry industry was the largest agricultural sector, and represented the majority of broiler and egg producers. There was a long term potential growth for both broiler meat and eggs, as they presented a best value proposition for consumers. Based on international data, the industry could grow substantially and address food security as well as job creation. The potential growth was dependent on economic growth. The broiler and egg industries were currently going through tough times, and there was export potential for the two industries if there were fair trade conditions. SAPA was working closely with DAFF, the Department of Trade and Industry (dti) and the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform (DRDLR), and provincial government relationships had improved. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe poultry industry was now the world&rsquo;s largest and most exported meat type. Only 13% of production was exported and 50% of global trade value was in dark meat surpluses. The total exports were worth about $18 billion a year and seven countries supplied the bulk of the exports. South Africa was the ninth biggest importer in the world, importing 20% of consumption mostly as surpluses and waste products, and was exporting 2% of production. South Africa represented less than 2% of global production, and was at risk from &ldquo;dumping&rdquo; and other low cost imports from the &ldquo;big players&rdquo; like the USA and Brazil. The country was extremely vulnerable, because in South Africa people eat all parts of the chicken, unlike the developed world. There was a need for an enabling environment to drive further transformation. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimated the global food production needed to increase by more than 40% by 2030 and 70% by 2050 in order to feed the growing population.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Lovell stated that the current Anti-dumping Duties (AD) application against three European (EU) countries had been finalised, but was still problematic. The alternate measures to deal with the EU were required. The effect of imports on job creation was massive as every 10 000 tons of meat imports equated to the loss of approximately 1 000 local direct and indirect jobs. The soya growth strategy, and the general grain market, needed a strong local poultry industry. It was important to highlight to the Members that the import prices were a secondary weighting to job creation -- local producers are job creators, and importers are job destroyers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOpportunities for frozen broiler and shell eggs exports were hampered by Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) measures and Non-Tariff Barriers (NTBs) which applied to South Africa. The dti was driving market access issues through the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) and DAFF and was targeting countries like Jordan, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar and Angola. The SPS risk analysis was identified by the World Organisation for Animal Health/Performance of Veterinary Services (OIE/PVS) report as a local weakness and DAFF, the University of Pretoria (UP) and the Poultry Disease Management Agency (PDMA) were working together to resolve the SPS regulatory requirements. Extra veterinary export assistance would be appreciated.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) had been of no benefit to the industry in South Africa, but the renewal was supported by the local poultry industry for national interest reasons. The AGOA was a unilateral agreement, so the USA could basically do what they wanted, but had no reason to harm the South African industry and economy. The local producers had met a US delegation in Atlanta and Washington last week to try and find an acceptable concession. The DAFF was actively involved in this exercise and the Minister, Mr Zokwana, was aware of the issue. The Department of Trade and Industry (dti) favoured direct industry-to-industry negotiations between the SAPA and the United States of America Poultry and Egg Export Council (USAPEEC).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe SAPA believed that there was a need for regulation in the brining process, and the concerns that had been raised were related to technical issues, as the current draft was flawed. There were also socio-economic impacts with brining, including the fact that the consumers would be paying more, there was a negative impact on nutrition and food security, and a potential collapse of the industry causing widespread unemployment. Brining improved the eating experience, as it improved the texture and succulence and also made the product cheaper and was the most effective marinating technique. All the products sold locally had to be safe according to the Foodstuffs, Cosmetics and Disinfectants (FCD) Act, and this was whether the product was brined or not. There was no evidence that current brine-based marinade formulation posed any health risks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA transformation committee had been established and there had been engagement with the dti&rsquo;s Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) Unit at the instruction of Minister. The industry was committed to improving market access, and several companies already had good stories to tell. Transformation could be accelerated if imports/ &ldquo;dumping&rdquo; and brining issues were resolved, and there was a need to work with DAFF and sector departments to set targets. SAPA was also working with DAFF to introduce new preferred breeds and was requesting assistance to get poultry declared a designated product for government procurement.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt was recommended that the Committee should help SAPA to maintain a national organisation for the promotion, development and guidance of the poultry industry by helping to enforce SPS measures. The Committee could also help to ban all illegal imports and exports from the EU and elsewhere -- countries like Australia and New Zealand had banned all imports for years. The USA currently banned SA exports of chicken for spurious SPS reasons and was encouraging DAFF to ensure compliance at all ports of entry, especially Durban.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Briefing by Association of Meat Importers and Exporters (AMIE) &nbsp;</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Georg Southey, Member of AMIE, indicated that the main objectives of AMIE were to promote and protect the interests of the members, and to confer and collaborate with all bodies controlling and administering the meat industry in the country. More importantly, AMIE conveyed the views and recommendations to all concerned in order to improve meat imports and exports, Imports always brought about affordable alternatives for the consumers and supplemented local production by providing a balance between supply and demand, and enhancing food security. The size of the South African market was about two 2 billion kg per annum, and was worth about R35 billion. Imports accounted for less than 10% by volume and value, while there had been 144 million kg of bone imports in 2013, representing less than 7% of local consumption.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Southey said that the import sector was also a catalyst for job creation, as it had created 5 000 local direct jobs and 10 000 indirect jobs. The domestic products left highly mechanised factories in retail-ready packs. The imported product arrived in bulk and had to be converted into retail-ready form. The domestic advantages included avoidance of export costs, freight clearing costs and duty. imports also had to go through the SPS requirements. All imported containers were subject to t inspection and certification, with laboratory testing for pathogens and bacteria. The import requirements were among the most stringent in the world and the importers were willingly complying with all these requirements.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe issue of food security in South Africa was a concern, as low income households spent 48% of their income on basic foodstuffs, of which chicken (animal protein) was the largest portion. The chicken inflation &ndash; above 8.5% -- was higher than the South African Reserve Bank&rsquo;s (SARB) 6% target. The AMIE believed that consumers should not be forced to pay more than necessary for basic foodstuffs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Southey said that brining was performed mainly by large producers and the barrier to entry for new entrants was because of a lack of access to technology and capital. There were concerns around increased sodium levels (health concern), as this was not cheap chicken but expensive water. AMIE supported original proposed 4% brining limit. The current tariff structure of the industry supported a flawed business model and the model needed to change to be able to pursue global competitiveness. Since 2012 the cost of feed had decreased to R7 billion per annum, and natural import protection had resulted from the depreciation of the Rand by between 27% and 33%. There were many challenges to the industry, including avian influenza and Newcastle disease. SAPA had returned to great profitability and there were more stable labour relations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Southey concluded by mentioning the opportunities that could be exploited, including exporting to Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries, including Mozambique, which was imported expensive chicken from Brazil. There was a need for the formulation of a Chicken Industry Development Plan to guide all the role players in the industry.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Discussion</strong><br />\r\nMr Maxegwana welcomed the presentation as a lot of issues had been covered. He wanted to know where people could find the brine chicken in the outlets, as customers often chose cheaper products. The SAPA had given information about the jobs that had been created for people, whether directly or indirectly, and AMEI had also indicated that 15 000 jobs had been created through imports. However, it was important to differentiate between permanent and temporary jobs, and the quality of jobs in terms of conditions and treatment, as workers worked under different conditions. He asked both the AMIE and SAPA to unpack the issue related to &ldquo;anti-dumping&rdquo; tariffs, and said Mozambique seemed to be benefiting from the chicken imports from Brazil.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn expressed disappointment that SAPA and AMIE were not aligned together, especially on the issue of exports and imports. The relationship between other industries also needed to be addressed so that there could be coordination on how the industry functioned. How far was the industry in dealing with the issue of diseases and avian influenza in domesticated birds? How far was the country on the imports of chicken? She opposed the idea that the county could put protectionism against imports and exports, and suggested that there was a need to open up the markets to allow competition, especially in around pricing. She wanted to know from SAPA why it was claimed that the country would be paying more for imported chicken.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn wanted to know whether there was any impact of brining on the market, as the AMIE seemed opposed to the process of brining. What had been done by the DAFF to prevent the illegal importation of chicken into the country? Why was the country battling to prevent the issue of illegal imports, as it was affecting the local industry? Which countries were these illegal imports coming from? South African had imposed &ldquo;anti-dumping&rdquo; tariffs of above 100% since 2000 on certain products derived from chicken carcasses. Why was the issue &ldquo;anti-dumping&rdquo; still in place?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Filtane asked SAPA why the industry was currently going through a &ldquo;tough time,&rdquo; as highlighted in the presentation. What was the rand value of trade in the industry? It had been pointed out that South Africa was the ninth biggest importer in the world, importing 20% of the consumption, mostly as surpluses and waste products. How good was that in terms of the wellness of the people and growth development? What was the rand value of the 2% of the exported products? Was there enough stock in the country to be able to be exported? What could the Committee do in terms of providing an enabling environment to drive further transformation? He asked SAPA to provide more information regarding the need for desiring a partnership to capacitate extension officers.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\nMr Filtane stated that it was disappointing that the AMIE presentation failed to touch on the issue of transformation. This government often lacked the appetite to invest in entities that did not factor in the issue of transformation. Education was one of the important parts of sustainable transformation. How could consumers differentiate between local and imported products?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson mentioned that agriculture was the second priority of the government in revitalising the economy and creating jobs. It was good to hear that financial assistance was not given to individuals, but rather to trusts in order to avoid a situation where money was used recklessly. She also wanted more information on the brining process. Who was mainly benefiting from the industry, as this was not quite clear in the presentation? She had expected that the SAPA and AMIE would give detailed information regarding transformation. What had been done to tackle youth unemployment in the country? What was the position of the entities regarding the issue of a National Minimum Wage (NMW?). The Committee needed to know where the sector could be assisted so as to be able to grow the economy of the country. Who had been benefiting from the brining process?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Sol Motsepe, Senior Executive: Broiler Liaison, SAPA, welcomed all the questions that had been asked by the Members and mentioned that the issue of brining was very complicated -- he had taken almost a year in order to fully understand the process. The industry needed to create awareness in the communities and the general public so that they had an understanding of what brining was. There was an agreement that there would be a meeting at the end of 2014 on how to bring about awareness on the issue, but for some reasons this had not materialised. The Committee was welcome to visit the facilities where the brining process was performed in order to observe the whole process personally.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Lovell responded that both DAFF and the Department of Home Affairs (DOH) had regulations on what could be said on the packaging of products, and all products had labelling stating what was in them. There was a label in front of the chicken product on whether it was brined or not, and how much had been brined. All the jobs in the industry were on a permanent basis, with the exception of one small category of job -- the &ldquo;catching team&rdquo; -- and it was only the bigger companies that had a permanent &ldquo;catching team&rdquo;. The table which dealt with broiler industry basically talked about the categories of employment, using the Paterson grading system, to see how many people were Paterson A and B (junior staff) or Paterson C and above (supervisory and senior staff). The entity did not provide a similar table for the egg industry, because it had a lot of inaccurate information. The local industry had been employing more people from the breeding process, slaughtering and processing and the distribution of the final product. In essence, the local industry had been employing more people per ton of meat than what the importers had been saying.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Lovell said that the country was working as a collective with the SADC countries in order to develop the industries within the region, to become better producers. There were big South African companies that had invested in the SADC region, and the exports were mainly in the form of money and expertise, rather than product. The new mills that had been provided by the dti, with subsidies, were meant to assist the companies which were grilling soya. There had been existing mechanisms to curtail the impact of avian influenza in the poultry industry in South African, and this had been put on the formal agenda for the &ldquo;USA and South Africa discussion&rdquo; last week. The South African Veterinary Authority (SAVA) had issued 38 veterinary control certificates in the last couple of years. and the USA had responded with only four certificates. In other words, South Africa had done a lot more work in this case than the USA. South Africa had not had any cases of avian influenza or Newcastle disease, but this did not mean it could not affect the industry, and Newcastle disease was often difficult to control.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Lovell said that the question on whether consumers paid more for imported products should be looked at from the viewpoint that there was no such thing as &ldquo;cheap food&rdquo; if there were no jobs available, and SAPA could create more jobs with local production than by importing chickens with better prices. Most of the countries allowed the brining process. It was an American technique and South Africa had imported European equipment to do it. It was an international practice, but was not universal. For example, Brazil brined their turkey but did not brine the chickens that were to be exported to South Africa. The levels of brining varied from country to country, and in most of the developed countries -- including Brazil -- fresh chicken was the primary food, not frozen chicken.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Lovell said that there was lack of information on where the illegally imported products were coming from, and these concerns had been raised with DAFF. The &ldquo;anti-dumping&rdquo; tariff was still in place because the USA was dumping in South Africa. The &ldquo;anti-dumping&rdquo; duty had been brought into effect in 2000 on an application that had been made in 1999. It just happened that within the same year, the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and the Trade Development and Cooperation Agreement (TDCA) between the European and South Africa had been signed into force. The &ldquo;anti-dumping&rdquo; duty had to be renewed every five years, and the USA had not participated properly in both of the renewal cycles, as it had failed to follow the rules. The industry had been going through &ldquo;tough times&rdquo; because the bulk of what had been produced had to be planned 22 months prior to consumption, and the imports had been fluctuating a lot on a monthly basis. The planning cycle of an importer was a lot shorter than that the cycle of a local producer and this had been creating a mismatch in the local industry. The SAPA compared the food and feed prices in the USA, Brazil and South Africa, and the local industry paid more for maize than the USA and very close to what Brazil had been paying, and paid more for soya than both of those two countries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2014, the rand value of imports had been just under R4 billion, which was a huge turnover and way bigger than any poultry industry. He highlighted that both the local and the imported products occasionally had either chemical or microbiological issues outside of limits, but there was certainty that the imported products were always older as there was a particular microbiological measure which could give one an idea of the age of the product. The local products were always fresher, but this did not insinuate that the imported products were of lower quality on average than the local products. He did not have information regarding the value of exports in rand but would try to get the exact figure and then send it to the Committee. The industry needed the businesses to be sustainably profitable so as to be able to invest in transformation, and sustainably profitable meant the industry would need to grow by a margin of 5% to7%. This was unlikely to happen, when one considered the unexpected maize drought throughout the country.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Lovell said that what made food security more stable in South Africa was because of the breeding process -- within a few months, the country could add approximately 15% to its production capacity. It would require more time to build up the breeding stock and the investment in the poultry industry in order for the country to move beyond that 15%.The industry had been trying to bring in small farmers in order to sell the chicken that had been produced by the HDIs at the higher prices. To do this, it would require the Treasury to give the industry concessions within the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe SAPA would do a follow up on the issue of land reform. The issue was that knowledge in agriculture had been privatised and private companies had been selling knowledge to their clients, and the extension officer services were very important to bring about transformation in agriculture. There had been commitments from both the DAFF and dti officials to work together on compliance with the competition laws so that whatever concessions that had been made by the industry were used for transformation purposes. The rule had been that if the product was pre-packed, then it should bear the name of the country of its origin, but if it was a Daily Star product, then it was impossible to know whether the product was locally produced or imported.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson thanked SAPA for the responses provided and indicated that the Members would be provided with the date on when the DAFF would be coming to respond to some of the outstanding questions. She reiterated that it was important for the country to deal with the issues of poverty, unemployment and inequality and this was an industry that had the capability to tackle these challenges.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Southey indicated that that if he was duplicating some of the responses that had been provided by SAPA, it was because AMIE had views that were mostly complementary, but slightly different, to SAPA&rsquo;s.The regulation in terms of the Agricultural Products Act and the Consumer Protection Act determined the labelling that should be on all products. The labelling regulation according to AMIE was redundant, as it was mostly understood only by those with science degrees. The jobs that were created through imports were permanent and quality jobs, and the entity would provide a detailed report with a table on the division of the jobs that had been created though imported products. It was estimated that 70% of the jobs in the industry were in formal retail,,and 30% in food service and informal retail.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Southey said that Brazil had not been &ldquo;dumping&rdquo; products in Mozambique, as Brazil was selling their whole chicken into Mozambique at higher prices than the South African prices for chicken. In essence, Mozambique paid a higher price and duty for the imported chicken from Brazil than what they would pay on the South African market. It was clear that the local South African chicken industry was &ldquo;inward thinking&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;outward thinking,&rdquo; because of its current production model. He suggested that it was important for either DAFF or dti to take the lead in getting together all the relevant role players, from the government and the industry, to debate critical issues on the way forward. Brining was happening not only in South Africa, as already pointed out by SAPA, and in most parts of the country brining was highly regulated in terms of limits and labelling. However, in most countries where brining was allowed, the limits were substantially less than South Africa, but it was on a limited scale.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Southey said that less that 2% of the total imported chicken products in South Africa had been brined and came mostly from Denmark. Every product that had to be imported to South Africa had to comply with what the local producers had to comply with, meaning the limits of brining for the local products would also apply to the imported products. There had been interactions with AMIE and other bodies to prevent the issue of illegal imports in South Africa and there could have been more success on the issue if there had been a joint effort between SAPA and AMIE. The imported products were also inspected and went through laboratory tests to check for pathogens and bacterial levels, and whether they were ready for consumption. The local products were fresher because they had been produced locally and therefore could reach the retail shops quicker than the imported products.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson thanked everyone who was present at the meeting.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe meeting was adjourned.</p>\r\n",

        "summary": "<p>The Portfolio Committee on Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries held briefings by the National Agricultural Marketing Council (NAMC), the South African Poultry Association (SAPA) and the Association of Meat Importers and Exporters (AMIE) on the challenges facing the industry. It was disclosed that there were currently 26 Ministerial Trustees, and trusts managed over R2 billion worth of assets -- mainly financial assets. The NAMC was mandated to manage the communication and reporting processes between the Minister of the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF), the Ministerial Trustees and Industry Trusts. It was also responsible for reporting on an annual basis to the Minister on the operations and functioning of the trusts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The challenges facing a number of trusts included the need for a more consultative nomination process, experience and industry exposure. The government&rsquo;s intervention had been limited to Trusts Deeds. Other challenges were poor demographic representation and male domination, accountability was often limited to beneficiaries (private sector and members) and the trusts were often insufficient to cover administration in the areas of transformation, empowerment and land reform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Members wanted to know whether there was a strategy in place to address the challenges that had been identified in the trusts. Was there an effort to facilitate and fast-track a legislative process that would assist in the governing of the trusts? How could one ensure that the R2 billion worth of assets would be accounted for? What was the process that had been used to identify the beneficiaries for bursaries and internships? One Member was disappointed that the trustees had not been invited to participate in the meeting, as they could have spoken for themselves about the challenges that had been experienced in the trusts. Was there a particular formula on how the trusts were distributed? Was there enough capacity in place to ensure that the money from the trusts had been used efficiently and effectively? It was generally disappointing that some of the trusts, such as the Citrus Industry Trust, had not been complying with transformation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The South African Poultry Association (SAPA) said that the broiler and egg industries were currently going through tough times, and the export potential for the two industries depended on fair trade conditions. SAPA was working closely with DAFF, the Department of Trade and Industry (dti) and the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform (DRDLR). South Africa was the ninth largest importer in the world, importing 20% of consumption -- mostly as surpluses and waste products -- and exporting 2% of production. South Africa represented less than 2% of global production, and was at risk from &ldquo;dumping&rdquo; and other low cost imports from the &ldquo;big players&rdquo; like the USA and Brazil. The broiler industry employed a total of 14 481 people and the egg industry added another 20 000 jobs, which were mainly permanent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The effect of imports on job creation was massive, as every 10 000 tons of meat imports equated to the loss of approximately 1 000 local direct and indirect jobs. Other challenges included increasing maize and soya prices, and illegal imports. It was important for DAFF to ensure compliance at all ports of entry, especially in Durban. The issue of transformation of the industry was also important, and SAPA had established a Transformation Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most Members wanted further clarity on the issue of &ldquo;anti-dumping&rdquo; tariffs. How was the industry dealing with the issue of diseases and avian influenza in domesticated birds? One Member was opposed to the protectionism that had been practised by the industry, and suggested the opening up of the markets to allow exports and imports. Was there enough stock in the country for the industry to export? What could the Committee do to provide an enabling environment to drive further transformation? What was the issue of brining all about, as it had not been clearly explained in the presentation?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The AMIE conveyed views and recommendations to improve meat imports and exports, as the current industry was practising protectionism. Imports brought about affordable alternatives for consumers and supplemented local production by balancing supply and demand, and provided food security. The size of the South African market was about two billion kg per annum, and was worth about R35 billion. Imports accounted for less than 10% by volume and value, while there had been 144 million kg of bone imports in 2013, representing less than 7% of local consumption. The import sector was a catalyst for job creation, as it had created 5 000 local direct jobs and 10 000 indirect jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The AMIE believed that the current tariff structure of the industry supported a flawed business model which needed to be changed in the pursuit of global competitiveness. However, the cost of feed had decreased by R7 billion per annum since 2012, and the rand depreciation had helped the industry to meet the challenge of import pricing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members expressed disappointment that the views of SAPA and AMIE were not aligned on the issue of exports and imports. They commented that the presentation made by AMIE had failed to touch on the issue of transformation. What was the impact of brining on the market, as AMIE seemed opposed to the process?&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "body": "<p>The DAFF was due to present the implementation plan for the Small-scale Fisheries Policy, but this was postponed as the Committee had noted that documentation was not signed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Extension and Advisory Services Policy: Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Mokutule Kgobokoe, Deputy Director-General, Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries stated that the purpose of the Extension and Advisory Services Policy (the policy) is to deliver and maintain a pluralistic, harmonised and co-ordinated extension and advisory service that operates on a common set of principles and values. The policy is intended to recognise the overall livelihood context within which extension and advisory services operates and to support producers on a wider livelihood system and sustainable development initiatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Long term issues pertaining to the policy centred around setting a regulatory framework to guide the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors in the provision of extension and advisory services. It was necessary to provide a common framework and set of principles to achieve shared over-arching objectives and priorities set out in the 2012 National Development Plan (NDP), the Industrial Policy Action Plan (IPAP) and integrated growth and development plans, and to facilitate the establishment of effective and efficient extension and advisory services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The long-term goals of the policy were thus to ensure that all sectors in the value chain would enjoy equitable and optimum excess to knowledge and skills, and have the capacity to explore opportunities for the advancement of their livelihoods and enterprises, as well as to respond to the needs and ambitions of the circumstances of the users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The policy seeks to transform and align the core competencies of extension practitioners towards the comprehensive development agenda, and to promote and implement the value chain approach for integrated and holistic support services. It applied to all three sectors in all rural and urban areas of South Africa and it applied to all modes of extension and advisory service delivery by government, the private sector, NGOs, and producer organisations and producers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More specifically, he explained the role of the Extension and Advisory Services unit of the Department of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF or the Department). It was to provide information to research institutions on production constraints of the producers, so that appropriate basic, applied and adaptive research could be conducted. This service would assist producers to identify and overcome production, enterprise and marketing challenges, through the exchange of information among producers, extension practitioners, input suppliers, creditors and marketing agents. The service was intended to empower and build capacity of producers, producer organisations and commodity groups to ultimately become self-reliant, for improved living standards. The unit was working with producers in technology development and innovation processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Kgobokoe highlighted that in recent decades the concept of extension had broadened. Current approaches emphasised the concepts of advice, facilitation, empowerment and learning. Facilitation and learning-based extension was believed to be placing the extension worker in a more responsive role as a &lsquo;knowledge broker&rsquo; or as a guide through unfamiliar institutional or technical landscapes to direct users to relevant information and advice.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn order to advance the extension education system and broaden service focus, the policy seeks to review and develop a multi-disciplinary training curriculum for extension practitioners, and to ensure their continuous professional development through systematic maintenance, improvement and broadening of knowledge and skills, and development of personal qualities necessary for the execution of the professional and technical duties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DAFF was presently seeking to recruit competent extension practitioners to augment the current human capital, and also trying to ensure the competence of extension professionals through registration with a recognised and credible professional body. It advocated that extension practitioners must become champions of the value chain approach, to integrate comprehensive value chain aspects into farming operations. It was promoting the support of market access opportunities for producers, especially smallholders, by negotiating for marketing outlets, including preferential procurement opportunities by state agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Kgobokoe then spoke to how the information was being disseminated. The policy sought to design user-friendly ICT knowledge sharing platforms, such as social networks, to effect mass communication which would ensure free accessibility to research outcomes. It was using a multi-lingual approach to enable open access information by all sectors across the value chain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DAFF was also looking at ways of facilitating demand-driven research and extension services by promoting action-based and producer-led research processes. It was, for instance, supporting programmes based on participatory on-farm trials, and research-station based research processes in order to ensure the inclusion of producers and extension practitioners in all research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He noted that this policy would also enable the Provincial Departments of Agriculture to provide a holistic, well-coordinated and collaborative approach. This would provide different actors with a platform to play specific roles in the development of a prosperous and sustainable agriculture sector. Further, it would improve, implement and monitor extension and advisory services strategies, norms and standards across the whole country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Kgobokoe summarised the intentions that this policy should:<br />\r\n- provide effective and efficient linkage mechanism between research, extension and producers<br />\r\n- improve access to quality extension and advisory services that were professional, reliable, relevant and accountable<br />\r\n- provide advance extension education system and broadened service focus<br />\r\n- promote a commodity value chain development approach<br />\r\n- provide sustainable food and nutrition security<br />\r\n- produce self reliant and confident producers through shared knowledge<br />\r\n- offer an integrated intervention, through the establishment of provincial Directorates for extension and advisory services, to ensure effective implementation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Kgobokoe stressed that the government remained committed to providing extension and advisory services without charge to those who could not afford to pay. A user-pay principle would apply in the case of producers and members of producer organisations that could afford to pay for the services rendered. To solve the problem of fiscal sustainability, it was felt that outsourcing, co-financing, contracting and private funding should be implemented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He noted that consultations on this policy had been held with all relevant stakeholders, including the Chief Executive Officers Public Entities and heads of provincial Departments of Agriculture.&nbsp; It was presented to the DAFF Exco, which recommended that it be tabled at MinMEC, and MinMEC then approved it on 26 September 2014. Still to be done were the consultations with the Directors-general and Ministerial clusters on Social and Economic Development, Cabinet Committee tabling and Cabinet approval.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Discussion</em></strong><br />\r\nMs A Steyn (DA) asked why it took so long for the Department to get funding approval, when the policy went to the Cabinet for the first time in 2008. She also requested the Department to provide a provincial and regional breakdown for the 3 000 recruited extension officers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Kgobokoe replied that the conceptualisation of the Extension Recovery Plan was done during 2008/9 period. It was then presented to and accepted by the National Treasury, and funding was approved. However, there was no policy at that stage to regulate the extension service. The policy development started in 2010, and it would be expedited.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn relation to the provincial breakdown, he said the Department had a register of extension officers which indicated their names and locations. The document would be sent to the Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr T Ramokhoase (ANC) wanted to know more about the policy objectives, and asked how the transformation of the core competencies of extension practitioners was going to assist the existing practitioners. Concerning the role of extension and advisory services, he wanted to establish how authentic the information to be provided to research institutions would be. Also, he enquired how the Department was going to improve and monitor extension and advisory services strategies, norms and standards in provinces. Finally, he asked for clarity on Provincial Directorates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Kgobokoe agreed that one ambition of the policy related to the transformation core competencies of extension practitioners. It could be done through reshaping the curriculum so that it was multi-disciplinary, and this would enable the officers to service all the actors in the value chain. In regard to authenticity of information he stated that information dissemination and exchange was critical. The officers must be the &quot;reservoir of information&quot; that was needed by producers. That was why the Department was about to introduce IT gadgets to provide information to farmers. For instance, the Department was using a smart pen tool that assisted in locating where the extension officer was and what he/she was doing. If the pen was not active, that meant the officer was not working.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Kgobokoe reported that insofar as provincial monitoring went, the Department was trying to forge a conversation so that people could have inputs in the services offered and add value to them. There were already Provincial Directorates in place but the emphasis would move to having ones specifically for extension officers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr L Filtane (UDM) wanted to find out if extension officers had access to labourers who were working regularly on the big, white commercial farms. He asked if the Department was going to make use of pre-existing institutions like Ntinga, which had extension officers who were not actually doing any work because of budget cuts. He asked if prior learning or experience was going to be considered for the qualifications of extension officers, pointing out that some may not have these although they did have vast&nbsp; experience in the field. He asked if there were colleges that offered studies in extension and advisory services. Finally, he asked the Department to comment on the issue of Provincial Agriculture Departments that had no budget for operations although people were drawing salaries monthly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Bonga Msomi, Chief Director, DAFF answered the question on access to labourers, explaining that the extension officers dealt only with farmers. He also spoke to the provincial budget cuts, and acknowledged that the Eastern Cape does have a problem on its operational budget, and DAFF had held a meeting with the Provincial Treasury. The Department had managed to buy vehicles for operations due to the Extension Recovery Plan which was discussed with National Treasury. He also acknowledged there were problems in Mthatha, and that was the responsibility of the National Government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Msomi also confirmed that prior learning and experience was to be incorporated. The target was to review the curriculum to make sure the student had done the necessary basics. There were plans to ask for a four-year qualification in agriculture before an extension officer could be appointed. Some of the current extension officers had been sent to workshops for upgrading their skills.&nbsp; Institutions like Ntinga would also included, as the intention was to establish partnerships with the aim of improving the extension service and for experiential training. There were existing colleges that produced both farmers and extension officers, Fort Cox being one example.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Z Jongbloed (DA) asked if the extension officers were going to work in all three sectors of the Department or if each sector was going to have its own set of extension officers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Msomi said the extension service would be tailored by the different branches of the Department to suit their needs. The policy did not exclude Fisheries and Forestry, but the Department was moving in the direction of finding solutions and alternatives there too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson wanted to find out if the Department had a tailor-made curriculum in order to develop all-rounders who would also be developers, and who could guide the Committee in developing better policies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Kgobokoe replied that the Department was working around the issue of the curriculum, and it was intended to be a multi-disciplinary curriculum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Filtane asked if there would be punitive measures for defaulters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Kgobokoe reported that it was felt that the service should be professionalised, through the Extension Recovery Plan. Each officer had to register as a member, and abide by the code of conduct, and the body would be guided by the general procedures in the public service. He agreed that if an extension officer had done something wrong, then punitive measures would be applied. .<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn asked how the policy was going to be funded if there were budget cuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Kgobokoe stated there was an annual budget of around R258 million from the Extension Recovery Plan, which served as the base line.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Senzeni Zokwana, Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, commented that he had taken note of the questions from the Members. There were several policies that were being developed that would answer some of the questions around training development, curriculum improvement, and capacity to support both Fisheries and Forestry. He mentioned that in a recent engagement he had held with farmers they indicated that some of their problems had to do with extension officers, and the Department was therefore looking into this and deciding on the ideal numbers to be allocated to farms, rural villages and towns, and cities. Lastly, he indicated that revitalising of agriculture colleges was being done, with three already receiving attention, in Eastern Cape, Limpopo and North West.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fisheries International Agreements: Committee Content Advisor briefings</strong><br />\r\nMs Nozuko Mgxashe, Content Advisor to the Committee, reported that the three International Agreements that DAFF tabled in Parliament and referred to the Committee for approval were not accompanied by any Draft Resolution. These three agreements were: The Agreement for the Establishment of the Indian Tuna Commission (IOTC); Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT); and the United Nation&rsquo;s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Agreement on Port State Measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because the tuna agreements (CCSBT) were quite old, it was possible that there might have been amendments to the original Agreements and other states/parties might have since acceded to the agreements. DAFF had not provided this information to the Committee. Although Japan, Australia and New Zealand initiated the CSSBT, the Fishing Entitys of Taiwan, Indonesia and the Korean Republic have since joined the Convention as members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the IOTC and CSSBT related to tuna-like species, they were in fact two different agreements that addressed different aspects. They were administered differently and will have different requirements upon accession. The Explanatory Memorandum provided by the DAFF should have included a clear briefing on each agreement instead of combining them in one paragraph, and it would have helped if, for each agreement, DAFF had provided information as set out in the Ratification/Accession Procedures of&nbsp; DIRCO and Rule 306(2) of the National Assembly Rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of the FAO Port State Measures on IUU Fishing which deals with the prevention, deterrence and elimination of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, the Department did not highlight the fact that the agreement would enter into force after 25 parties had signed the agreement. 92 countries approved this agreement in 2009. Currently, 11 countries had ratified it the last being Mozambique, which was the third African country to do so, on 19 August 2014. She suggested that the DAFF must explain the basis for the decision to accede to, rather than ratify, the agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She added that DAFF had said very little about the Port State Measures on IUU Fishing in the explanatory memorandum, except that South Africa was already implementing the National Port State Measures. Similar information was required as for the IOTC and CCSBT, as per the Ratification/Accession procedures of DIRCO and the Rule 306 (2) of the National Assembly should have been provided for this agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the Department highlighted increased foreign revenue and employment opportunities if South Africa acceded to the agreements, it did not address implications for vulnerable groups, additional human and financial capacity that would be needed (as the ports of the country were likely to be open to more foreign vessels) nor the implications for national security as officials at Fisheries did not work 24 hours but an 8-hour day. Most illegal activities at sea took place at night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In summary, Ms Mgxashe noted that the DAFF&#39;s explanatory memorandum was misleading in mentioning that membership to the CCSBT &ldquo;would allow South Africa to table its concerns and to influence decisions taken at these regional fisheries management organisations&rdquo;. In addition, the explanatory memorandum mentioned that in accepting the Port State Measures on IUU Fishing of FAO, South Africa would have an opportunity to make use of the assistance that FAO offered to developing states, but although the agreement did mention that, it also specified that priority was given to the Least Developed States and Small Islands, and South Africa does not fall into that category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Legal opinion indicators</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Mgxashe also noted that the legal opinions of the State Law Advisors from the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development (DOJCD) and DIRCO did not accompany the agreements when they were tabled to the Committee. However, she had discovered that legal opinions were all provided and signed a few years ago as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>IOTC signed in September 2008 (DOJCD) and 2009 (DIRCO)</li>\r\n\t<li>CCSBT signed in September 2010 (DOJCD) and August 2011 (DIRCO)</li>\r\n\t<li>Port State Measures for IUU Fishing signed in September 2011 (Office of the Chief State Law Advisor in Cape Town) and March 2012 (DIRCO)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>It was possible that certain subsequent developments had taken place, in terms of the international agreements of the country. This was a serious matter that DAFF should address before the agreements could be approved, and DAFF should indicate the implications of the legal opinions signed a few years ago. For example, the IOTC legal opinions were provided in 2008 and 2009. The Fisheries Management Branch, at that time, was the Marine and Coastal Management Division of the former Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism. The Department should explain the implications of these changes, and also in terms of the administration of the Marine Living Resources Act, 1998 (Act No.18 of 1998) which had, since 2014, been amended to accommodate small-scale fisheries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Financial implications</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Mgxashe noted that, in respect of the financial implications, the Department only indicated the annual membership fees for the IOTC and the CCSBT and reported there would be no financial implications for the Port State Measures, as South Africa was a member of the FAO, which was the custodian of this Agreement. The IOTC membership fees had been presented in US dollars while the CCSBT were in Australian dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because South Africa had been a cooperating and non-contracting party to the two tuna agreements and had been implementing Port State Measures already, this meant the Department has been involved in certain activities including compliance to regulations. On accession, the country may need to be involved in additional activities and be subjected to more compliance measures regarding Port State Measures. In this regard, there would be financial implications for additional and qualified personnel and equipped vessels including personnel to operate the vessels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Specific issues on the International Agreements</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Mgxashe highlighted that the IOTC and CCSBT dealt with technical matters relating to the conservation and management of tuna species in the Indian Ocean and adjacent seas and the southern Bluefin tuna respectively. In all sessions of the IOTC and CCSBT, each member state must be represented by one delegate who may be accompanied by an alternate, experts and advisors. Expenses for attending these sessions were the responsibility of the participating governments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Exploratory Memorandum stated that on accession to the IOTC, the Department should appoint officials from DAFF to represent the country in these meetings. These should constitute a Commissioner, Fisheries Officer, Fisheries Researcher, Compliance Officer and an International Relations Officer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTherefore, as a cooperating non-contracting party to the IOTC, the Department should, amongst other things:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>indicate if it already had qualified personnel to assume the five listed positions to represent the country at the IOTC accession</li>\r\n\t<li>indicate who was previously, and is currently, representing the country as delegates in the IOTC and CCSBT sessions</li>\r\n\t<li>indicate if all the accompanying people were from DAFF or outside DAFF</li>\r\n\t<li>indicate if, for previous meetings, any financial assistance had been received by some DAFF officials to attend the IOTC meetings through the Meeting Participation Fund for Representatives from Developing States</li>\r\n\t<li>provide details of the employment of South Africans currently gained from the 40 tons total allowable catch (TAC) for the southern Bluefin tuna, and what would be the possible gains from a 110 ton increase if the country acceded to the CCSBT</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Mgxashe concluded that DAFF, including the Fisheries Branch, was known to have a general challenge in terms of technical skills capacity, and this might compromise the ability of the Department to effectively implement the provisions of the international agreements. It was thus very important that the Department should explain the penalties associated with contravening the provisions of the agreements and the implications of not meeting some of its obligations. Furthermore, the Department must indicate the financial implications for hiring the required personnel or for use of consultancy services, including the specific activities and duration for which the consultants would be used if there was not sufficient internal expertise to execute some of the provisions. Lastly, the Department must specify the financial implication for any plans that there might be to ensure capacitation to execute the responsibilities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><em>Discussion</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr C Maxegwana (ANC) wanted to know why the Fisheries Branch of DAFF had not signed the document to be presented to the Committee, when it knew long ago it had an engagement with Parliament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Z Mandela (ANC) remarked that the Committee could not do the work as expected if the reports were not signed and there was no explanation given for not signing the work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms A Steyn (DA) commented it was hard for the Committee to do its research and make recommendations on reports to be presented to the Committee if the reports were not received in time and not signed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr T Ramokhoase (ANC) suggested that the DAFF should be told to attend to the outstanding issues urgently. It was impossible for the Committee to move forward without this.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson remarked that the Department did not appear to take the Committee seriously. She indicated that the proposed presentation would not be allowed if the documents were not signed. The Committee had already written to the Department to voice its displeasure about the treatment it was receiving, and pleaded with the Minister, Deputy Minister and Director-General to take the Committee seriously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The meeting was adjourned.</p>\r\n",

        "summary": "<p>The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF), with the Minister present, briefed the Committee on the development of the National Extension and Advisory Services Policy (the policy) which was intended to guide the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors in the provision of extension and advisory services, to provide a common framework and set of principles to achieve shared over-arching objectives and priorities set out in the National Development Plan, Industrial Policy Action Plan and integrated growth and development plans, as well as to achieve efficient extension and advisory services. Consultation had been done on the policy with a number of relevant stakeholders, in public entities and provincial departments, and referred to MinMEC, which had approved it, but it still needed to get Cabinet approval.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIts long-term goals were to ensure that all sectors in the value chain enjoyed equitable and optimum excess to knowledge and skills, and had the capacity to explore opportunities for the advancement of their livelihoods and enterprises; and to respond to the needs and ambitions of the circumstances of the users. In order to broaden the focus and advance the extension education system, it was intended to review and develop multi-disciplinary training curriculums for extension practitioners, and to ensure continuous professional development through systematic maintenance, improvement and broadening of knowledge and skills, and development of personal qualities. The policy was also looking into how best to facilitate demand-driven research and extension services, by promoting action-based and producer-led research processes, including participatory on-farm trials, research-station based research and inclusion of both producers and extension practitioners. The policy should contribute to sustainable food and nutrition security, produce self reliant and confident producers through shared knowledge, and offer an integrated intervention through the establishment of provincial directorates.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMembers asked why it took so long for the Department to get funding approval, when the policy had already been to the Cabinet in 2008. They wanted a provincial and regional breakdown for the 3 000 recruited extension officers, asked how transformation of core competencies would assist existing practitioners, asked if experience would be recognised, who were the training institutions, and whether Ntinga was included. They highlighted that some extension practitioners were employed, but basically also wanted more detail on whether this policy was intended specifically for the agriculture sector or would extend to fisheries and forestry, how it would be monitored and how effective implementation would be ensured.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe DAFF was due to present the implementation plan for the Small-scale Fisheries Policy, but this was postponed as the Committee had noted that documentation was not signed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Committee&#39;s Content Advisor provided a detailed analysis and comment on the three international fishing agreements that had been brought to the Committee, namely: The Agreement for the Establishment of the Indian Tuna Commission (IOTC); Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT); and the United Nation&rsquo;s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Agreement on Port State Measures. Firstly, she highlighted some important omissions. The three agreements were not accompanied by any Draft Resolution. Because the tuna agreements were quite old, it was possible that there might have been amendments to the original agreements, and information was needed on whether any other states had acceded or joined as members. There was also a misleading implication that the two agreements in relation to tuna were to be considered in the same way, whereas they were two different agreements, addressing different aspects, administered differently and not with the same requirements around accession. The explanatory memorandum by DAFF fell short in not providing a clear briefing on each instead of attempting to combine them. No information was set out on the ratification processes to be followed in terms of the Department of International Relations and Cooperation and National Assembly rules. In relation to the Port State Measures agreement, the Department also did not highlight that it would be enter into force after 25 member states had signed, not ratified: 92 had approved the agreement in 2009 and 11 had ratified so far. DAFF should have explained the basis for the decision to accede rather than ratify. Again, more information was needed on the process. In addition, the explanatory memorandum fell short in giving detail. It highlighted the increased foreign revenue and employment opportunities if South Africa acceded, but did not address the implications for vulnerable groups, additional human and financial capacity that would be needed (as the ports of the country were likely to be open to more foreign vessels) nor the implications for national security as officials at Fisheries did not work 24 hours but an 8-hour day. It was also misleading in suggesting that South Africa would have an opportunity to make use of the assistance that FAO offered to developing states, failing to mention that South Africa did not qualify for priority as it was not considered a least developed state. The legal opinions of the State Law Advisers from the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development and International Relations and Cooperation had been prepared, but several years ago. These were not attached to the agreements tabled to the Committee, and it was necessary for DAFF to explain whether those opinions were affected by subsequent developments, most specifically the reconfiguration of the Department itself. DAFF also failed to be specific on the financial implications, and had not explained whether South Africa, as a cooperating and non-contracting party, had already received assistance for sending people to meetings. Finally, she pointed out that DAFF already faced a general challenge in terms of technical skills capacity, and this might compromise the ability of the Department to effectively implement the provisions of the international agreements, so that the DAFF would have to specifically address how it was planning to overcome this, what the penalties might be if it failed to comply and what the wider implications would be.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMembers agreed that it was not acceptable for the DAFF to fail to sign documents sent to the Committee and that the agreements could not be considered without the supporting information. The Chairperson indicated that she had already been in touch with the Minister and Department to complain about the general attitude of the DAFF to the Committee and called for increased cooperation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Every year the Auditor-General tables reports on the accounts and financial management of the various government departments and State institutions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHeads of government departments and institutions are regularly called by this committee to report and account for expenditure. The Committee can recommend that the National Assembly takes corrective actions if necessary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Members&#39; Legislative Proposals and Petitions Committees</strong><br />\r\nDraft bills can be submitted by individual Members of the National Assembly. These bills are considered by the National Assembly&#39;s Standing Committee on Private Member&#39;s Legislative Proposals and Special Petitions. If the Committee agrees with the principle of the draft Bill, a Bill will be prepared and dealt with by Parliament.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe National Council of Provinces Select Committee on Members&#39; and Provincial Legislative Proposals considers draft Bills from individual NCOP members and provincial legislatures.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPetitions may also be tabled in Parliament and referred to the relevant committee that deals with the issue raised in the petition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Internal Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Assembly has a number of internal committees that deal with matters affecting the running of Parliament. The Committees normally consist of senior Members of Parliament. The Rules Committee and its sub-committees deal with House rules, the budget of the House, support for Members, internal arrangements, and powers and privileges of members. Other internal Committees are the Programme Committee that plans the work of the Assembly, the Disciplinary Committee, and the Committee of Chairpersons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe National Council of Provinces has its own domestic Committees. The Rules Committee and its subcommittees deal with the NCOP rules, the NCOP budget, parliamentary privileges, internal arrangements, international relations and delegated legislation. The Programme Committee plans the work of the NCOP and the Committee of Chairpersons make recommendations about the functioning of Committees and other NCOP forums.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Ad hoc Committees</strong><br />\r\nParliament or one of its Houses may appoint an ad hoc (temporary) Committee when a special task must be done. When the task is complete, the Committee is dissolved.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Joint Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces together appoint a number of joint committees, for example the Constitutional Review Committee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and the Joint Standing Committee on Defence are statutory Committees. This means that they are established, by the Constitution or by an Act of Parliament, as well as in terms of the rules of Parliament.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe committees play a very important role in the process of building democracy and involving the public in the processes and activities of Parliament.</p>\r\n",

        "body": "<p><strong>Briefing by Office of the Auditor-General of South Africa (AGSA)</strong><br />\r\nMr Fanie Kock, Senior Manager: AGSA, briefed the Committee on the review of the second and third quarter monitoring reports for Programmes 2, 3 and 5 of the Department.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Programme 2: Agriculture Production, Health and Food Safety</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs per the 2014/15 APP targets for Quarter 2, the animal disease management plan had been developed, and the Gap Analysis Report was to be discussed with the stakeholders. Though the report had been developed and accepted during Quarter 1, no consultations with stakeholders had taken place in Quarter 2. The AG indicated there was no documentation to support the reasons listed for variances.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Quarter 3, the AG discovered that 12.5% of the reasons for variances were unreliable, and 12.5% of reported targets were not valid and accurate. As per the 2014/15 APP targets, two animal improvement schemes had been monitored and their performance data collected. Data collection was said to be continuing well. The AG noted that the report drawn for the collection of the data was dated 23 January 2015. Therefore the target was achieved only in Quarter 4. No reason was given for the variance listed in Quarter 3.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Department had commissioned the construction of mobile clinics. However, the construction of the 28 to 32-ton trucks, to be converted into mobile clinics, had been delayed. The AG found no supporting documentation to support the reasons listed for variances.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Programme 3: Food Security and Agrarian Reform</em><br />\r\nWith regard to Quarter 2, the AG had uncovered that 40% of the reasons for variances had not been provided, and that 20% of reported targets were not reliable.&nbsp; As per the 2014/15 APP targets, the Department had had to develop norms and standards for comprehensive producer development support. These norms and standards were still being developed in partnership with the National Agricultural Marketing Council (NAMC). The consultation process was expected to take place during Quarter 4. The AG indicated that the comment on the deviation, noted in the report, did not provide a reason why the target had not been met. It stated only what had been done in the quarter and what still needed to be done for the target to be achieved.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOut of the 16 000 smallholder producers that were to be supported during the 2014/15 period, only 3 000 smallholder producers had been supported during Quarter 2. The audit had been performed for verification and completeness, and findings had been identified. The AG stated that the detailed listing did not agree with the figure reported in the Quarter 2 report. The AG further noted invalid ID numbers, and some ID numbers noted on the listing did not agree with the supporting documentation. Attendance registers had not been signed by participants, and the attendance registers had not been prepared on official DAFF stationery. Not all supporting documents were available.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Programme 5: Forestry and Natural Resource Management</em><br />\r\nConcerning Quarter 2, the AG said that 50% of reasons for variances had not been provided, while 50% of reported targets were not reliable.&nbsp; 500 ha of woodlands and indigenous forests were to have been rehabilitated during this financial period.&nbsp; Quarter 2 had seen 125 ha of woodlands and indigenous forests rehabilitated. The Department had not supplied monthly reports, but only consolidated reports from the regions. The AG noted that consolidated reports were currently available and indicated the number of hectares rehabilitated. The daily and monthly reports had not been received, and the AG could not verify the reliability of the reported target.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRegarding Quarter 3, 20% of reason for variances had not been provided, while 20% of reported targets were not reliable.&nbsp; According to the 2014/15 APP targets, 500 ha of woodlands and indigenous forests were to have been rehabilitated during the 2014/15 period. The target set for Quarter 3 was 125 ha. A total of 125.65 ha of state indigenous forests had been rehabilitated. However, no reason had been provided for exceeding the target.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother target of 125 out of 500 ha of woodlands and indigenous forests had been set for Quarter 3, but the regions had not provided monthly reports. The AG had found that it was only consolidated reports that indicated the number of hectares rehabilitated. The monthly reports that filtered into these consolidated reports had not been received. Therefore, the AG could not verify the reliability of the reported target.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Meisie Nkau, Business Executive, AGSA, informed the Members that the information presented on a quarterly basis had to be complete and credible, because it was presented for audit, and was finally included in the annual report. She suggested the Committee should call upon the DAFF audit committee to make sure that what was presented was credible. All the deficiencies should be picked up during its interactions with the audit committee. Information provided to the Committee should first be presented to the internal audit committee before the Department presented it to the Committee, so that the facts were verified and the information presented was credible and reliable.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf systems were not working, it was clear the information presented to the Committee would not be reliable. The credibility check was done only at the end of the year, not quarterly, and the Department needed to address this. If this was not done, then consequence management should be administered.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Briefing by Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF)</strong><br />\r\nMs Edith Vries, Director General, DAFF, said that the Department had achieved 79% against all annual set targets. Total expenditure for Quarter 2 per economic classification and per programme was standing at 26.6%. Total expenditure for Quarter 3 per economic classification and per programme was at 28.8%.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>(Tables and graphs to illustrate budget expenditure were shown)</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Department had focused on accelerated production to enhance food security. The Cabinet had approved the national policy on food and nutrition during September 2013. The Fetsa Tlala (End Hunger) food production initiative had been launched in order to focus on under-utilised agricultural land and the production of staple food, to realise enhanced food production at national and household level, and to place one million hectares under production. The Minister and Deputy Minister of DAFF, with provincial and local leadership, had unveiled a &ldquo;food mountain&rdquo; on 16 October 2014 in commemoration of World Food Day.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Department had mobilised and supported smallholder producers to increase production and access export market opportunities through the World Food Programme (WFP). 11 026 smallholder farmers had been supported with technical advice and training. Six fish farms had been supported through the Aquaculture Development and Enhancement Programme.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe National Extension and Advisory Services Policy and its implementation plan had been approved by MINMEC at its 26 September 2014 meeting. 72 cooperatives had been supported with training. The fruit industry value chain network had been institutionalised and working groups established.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Department had commissioned the construction of pre-fabricated mobile veterinary clinics. A draft report had been received from the World Organisation for Animal Health and shared with the Committee. Genetic material had been collected for both indigenous Namaqua Afrikaner sheep and speckled goats. Pest management interventions for the invader fruit flies had taken place in Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe draft Cabinet memo on the signing of the Comprehensive African Agricultural Action Plan (CAADP) compact had been presented during the African Renaissance Committee that was held on 18 November 2014, and the Minister had approved it for submission to the Cabinet for final approval.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConcerning fisheries management, 2 516 sea-based and land-based inspections and investigations of rights holders were conducted in the four prioritised fisheries sectors. The Small-Scale Fishers Policy had been implemented. The permit conditions for West Coast rock lobster and abalone for 2014/15 were formulated and approved. Research on conditioning of brood stock and spawning induction methods had been conducted on spotted grunter.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRegarding governance and administration, the risk management implementation plan had been approved and implemented by the Risk Management Committee. Five sectoral policies were reviewed for alignment to key strategic priorities and protocols. The Strategic Plan and Annual Performance Plan had been aligned to the Medium Term Strategic Framework (MTEF). The communication strategy has been aligned to the MTEF and media plans had been implemented for key events such as the Female Entrepreneur Awards. Funds had been disbursed to the Agricultural Research Council and universities for targeted research and development programmes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn human resources, it was highlighted there were more men than women in the Department, particularly at senior management level. As a result, in its advertisements for senior managers, the Department had encouraged females and the disabled to apply. In the short term, this gap was not going to be reduced because of the reduced rate of filling positions. The Executive Management Development Programme had been devised to favour young women. The Department had noted that the bulk of its workforce was aging. The management practices had greatly improved and the reduction in the number of grievances lodged and disciplinary cases addressed proved this.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe vacancy rate was said to be fluctuating. At the end of the 2013/14 financial-year, it was at 9.6%, below 10%. However, during Quarter 1 of 2014/15, it rose to 10, 3% and was at 11% on 1 January 2015. The increased vacancy rate was due to the freezing of filling of positions, owing to the budget cuts which the National Treasury had imposed on the compensation of employees.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>(Tables and graphs were shown to illustrate the staff profile and HR dashboard)</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Vries said the Department had not achieved its targets in a number of areas. Among other things, not all of the 18 500 ha of agricultural land had been rehabilitated. Internal consultation on the draft Aquaculture Bill had not taken place. About 20 000 ha had not been cultivated for food production in communal areas and land reform projects. The comprehensive Agricultural Information Management System (AIMS) had not been completed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo remedy the situation, the Department had developed a Corrective Action Plan. Its main objectives were to strengthen consequence management in order to encourage behavioural change, improve risk management and reporting, reduce repeat audit findings by 60%, strengthen interdepartmental cooperation and collaboration, and accelerate collaboration with stakeholders through existing forums and commodity group deployments.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Transfer of Ncera Farms (Pty) Ltd</strong><br />\r\nMr Joe Kgobokoe, Deputy Director-General, DAFF, informed the Committee that the established task team had reported that the deregistration of Ncera Farms was the responsibility of the Department and the Minister, and the process had been initiated. The intention was to align deregistration with the transfer. Documents had been sent to the Ministry to effect the deregistration process. According to the arrangements, the farms were to be transferred to the Agricultural Research Council (ARC).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt was noted that the delisting had not happened yet. The letter was still to be signed by the Department of Finance because it involved the transfer of a public entity from one department to another. The matter of transfer of staff still awaited further discussions and recommendations from the task team.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Kgobokoe also indicated there was a proposal to hand over movable and non-movable assets to the ARC. This is still work in progress, and the ARC had been engaged on the possibility of handing over the operational area of the centre. Furthermore, the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform (DRDLR) had been approached to deal with the farms, and was working on an approach to take over the farms.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe role of the Department of Public Works (DPW) had been to research and to present the ownership status of the Ncera Farms in totality to the task team. The ownership status had been presented to the task team. The farms had been registered under the Minister of Public Works, the South African Development Trust, and the Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform. The support of the farmers would be taken care of by the provincial DRDLR.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Discussion<br />\r\nAGSA Presentation</em><br />\r\nMs A Steyn (DA) commented that last year the Minister and the Department had made commitments that documents to be presented to the Committee would be submitted in time, but the presented report was not showing any signs of improvement. She was concerned about the deficiencies noted regarding invalid ID numbers and tractors that were never delivered to provinces, yet the Department had not reported to the Committee to confirm these matters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Kock said the monitoring of commitments was an internal audit role to make sure information coming from the management of the Department was verified and credible. When the audit committee went through a report, it focused on high-risk areas. Then when the audit was done, the Department was taken through the findings so that it could assist the audit committee with fact verification. All the issues had been followed up and discussed with the Department.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr T Ramokhoase (ANC) wanted to know what the AG did when the report gave no reason for variance, before coming to the Committee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Kock explained that the Department was given the opportunity to present to the AG, but if it gave the AG unreliable information, the issue would remain in the report.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Z Jongbloed (DA) asked why a sample of Fisheries was not included in the sample the AG had presented to the Committee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Kock replied that information would be requested from the Fisheries Department of the Western Cape, and would be forwarded to the Committee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn remarked the internal audit committee appeared not to be functioning well. She suggested the Committee should get the Management Report so that it could ask questions and make an input.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Nkau maintained that if the internal audit was failing, then the audit committee was not going to have sufficient information. It was important the Department made sure the internal audit committee had the capacity to do its work so that it produced reliable information. Concerning the Management Report, she said the Committee could get it directly from the Department, as required by legislation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Z Mandela (ANC) enquired why the Committee could not be furnished with sufficient information on a quarterly basis, because the information provided to the AG was insufficient.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Nkau said there should be agreement about the root cause of the deficiency so that it could be fixed. If there was disagreement, the problem would remain the same. She indicated that the Department spent most of its time implementing, and less on reporting. However, it was still its responsibility to do quarterly reports, because it was going to be audited at the end of the year.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn felt it was unfair for Members to debate the reports of the Department for Quarters 2 and 3, because they had received them only when the meeting started.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Mandela supported Ms Steyn, saying the matter should be reported to the Speaker of the Parliament, letting him know the Committee had postponed a meeting because it was not getting help from the Department.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Ramokhoase suggested the Committee should engage with the Department because if it did not, the Committee was going to be behind schedule.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Vries apologised for the situation, and took responsibility for the actions of the Department. She said the mismanagement of the documents had been the responsibility of her unit, but indicated the documents had been prepared for the 17 February 2015 Committee meeting, which had been cancelled.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn disagreed with Ms Vries. She told her the 17 February 2015 Committee meeting had never been cancelled, and asked for clarity on how a meeting should go forward when the documents were late.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Vries said her office had had an interaction with the office of the Committee about the meeting, but the Committee had replied it would not interact with an acting director-general.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson stated there had been a meeting on 17 February, and asked why the documents were not circulated if they were sent to the Committee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn, however, proposed that the meeting continue, as there were important things to consider.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Ramokhoase supported Ms Steyn.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>DAFF Presentation</em><br />\r\nMr Ramokhoase remarked that the Committee wanted to see an active Department that would directly deal with its mandate. When the Committee did its own research, it always disagreed with what the Department presented. If the Department was there to convince the Committee about what it does, then it should explain how it was implementing its policies and provide evidence on projects it was busy with.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn stated there was inconsistency in what the Department said it does and what was seen on the ground. On the issue of the construction of mobile veterinary clinics, the AG had indicated that this had not happened &ndash; it was delayed. However, the report of the Department said this was commissioned.<br />\r\nFurther, on the Fetsa Tlala project, she said she had visited the scheme and farmers had informed her there was no drought and planting had started very late. Lastly, she wanted clarity on why the first draft of the Fishing Rights Allocation Framework had not been completed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Senzeni Zokwana, Minister: DAFF, said that the mobile clinics were there, but if the AG said they were not there, then the Department needed to forward to the Committee a proper answer without giving a generalised response. With regard to Fetsa Tlala, he said a thorough report on projections by the Department would be sent to the Committee, because the Department knew what had been planted and on how many hectares of land.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn why the first draft of the Fishing Rights Allocation Framework had not been completed, he said a report would be given to the Committee with an explanation on why the rights had been postponed. The industry needed to be given a guarantee that fishing would continue. Already, there was uncertainty within the industry about fishing. The report would also cover research issues and chart a way forward.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Jongbloed remarked that the presentation on Fisheries could be masqueraded as a Master&rsquo;s degree paper. The report was mum on a number of areas, like roll-overs of fishing rights; lobster, abalone and line fish poaching; a gazetted fee structure for fishing rights; and research on pelagic fisheries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson enquired if the Department was still on course to meet the 2019 target of one million ha of land for Fetsa Tlala. He also asked about the status of the Performing Animals Protection Amendment Bill.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Kgobokoe said the Department was on its way to meeting the set target, but the challenge was the budget of the Department, which was not increasing. Resources were a challenge. If the Department was to meet its target of one million hectares, the budget had to be increased. Concerning the Performing Animals Protection Amendment Bill, he indicated that an Inter-Ministerial Task Team had been established to look into the matter.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn wanted to establish if regulations were in place for importing maize because of the drought.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Kgobokoe said that the domestic consumption of maize was 11 million tons a year. The decrease was attributed to drought, which was why it was felt that millions of tons should be imported. The matter was still on the table -- how pricing was going to be done, and the country from which the maize would come.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Ncera Presentation</em><br />\r\nGeneral Bheki Cele, Deputy Minister, DAFF, admitted that the Department had failed the project, and that had to be known. It was important to interrogate the workings of the entity, including its transfer, so as to avoid failing for a second time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn agreed with General Cele, saying the Department was not looking at what it was supposed to look at. The next thing that would follow was the closure of agricultural colleges.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr B Joseph (EFF) stated that people and farmers in the Eastern Cape had been failed. The Minister should apply his mind thoroughly on what he wanted to do and think carefully about what he was doing about Ncera, and not rush into signing documents and contracts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson said it was clear the Department had not done its work on Ncera since the oversight visit. It was now giving the Committee a reason to open up a discussion on the matter. The Committee recommended that Ncera be delisted, and the Department must make sure those communities around the ten farms did not lose the services the entity offered.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe meeting was adjourned.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The root cause pointed to internal control deficiencies, which indicated that the Department&rsquo;s strategic plan was not consistent with its annual performance plan (APP), as required by the National Treasury.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn Programme 2 (Agriculture Production, Health and Food Safety), the AG discovered there had been no consultation with stakeholders during Quarter 2 regarding the Gap Analysis Report on the animal disease management plan. There had been no supporting documentation for the reasons for the variances listed. For Quarter 3, 12.5% of reasons for variances had been unreliable, and 12.5% of reported targets had not been valid and accurate. The Department had commissioned the construction of trucks to be converted into mobile veterinary clinics, but the clinics had been delayed. There had been no documentation to support the reason for this.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConcerning Programme 3 (Food Security and Agrarian Reform), the AG reported that 40% of reasons for variances had not been provided, and that 20% of reported targets were not reliable. Out of the 16 000 smallholder producers that were to have been supported during the 2014/15 period, only 3 000 had received support during Quarter 2.&nbsp; As per the 2014/15 APP targets, the Department had had to develop norms and standards for comprehensive producer development support. The consultation process was expected to take place during Quarter 4. The AG said the comment on the deviation noted in the report did not provide a reason why the target had not been met.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn Programme 5 (Forestry and Natural Resource Management), the AG reported that 50% of the reasons for variances were not provided, while 50% of reported targets were not reliable.&nbsp; 500 ha of woodlands and indigenous forests should have been rehabilitated during this financial period.&nbsp; Quarter 2 had seen 125 ha of woodlands and indigenous forests rehabilitated. The AG could not verify the reliability of the reported targets, because daily and monthly reports had not been received.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) indicated it had achieved 79% of all its annual set targets.

Research on the conditioning of brood stock and spawning induction methods had been conducted on spotted grunter.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe risk management implementation plan had been approved and implemented. Five sectoral policies had been reviewed for alignment to key strategic priorities and protocols. The strategic plan and APP and had been aligned to the Medium Term Strategic Framework.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the issue of deregistering the Ncera Farms, it was reported that this was the responsibility of the Department and Minister, and the process had been initiated. The intention was to align deregistration with the transfer. Documents had been sent to the Ministry to effect the deregistration process. The delisting had not happened yet. The letter was still to be signed by the Department of Finance because it involved the transfer of a public entity from one department to another.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMembers voiced concern about deficiencies reported, such as invalid ID numbers and tractors that were never delivered to provinces, yet the Department had not reported to the Committee to confirm these matters. They felt it was unfair to have to debate the reports of the Department for Quarters 2 and 3, because they had received them only when the meeting started, and it was suggested this matter should be reported to the Speaker of the Parliament.&nbsp; They remarked that there was inconsistency in what the Department said it does, and what was seen on the ground.&nbsp; Was the Department still on course to meet the 2019 target of one million ha of land for Fetsa Tlala?&nbsp; Were regulations in place for importing maize because of the drought? They criticised the Department for not doing its work on Ncera Farms since their oversight visit.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "body": "<p>The Chairperson apologised to everyone present for her late arrival to the meeting. She welcomed the delegation from the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, which was headed by the Director General.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nApologies were received from Mr Senzeni Zokwana, Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries; General&nbsp;Bheki Cele, the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, and Mr L Ntshayisa (AIC).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson requested that the DG commence with the presentation of the Department&rsquo;s response on the State of the Nation Address after introducing any new member in the delegation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Response by the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) on the State of the Nation Address</strong><br />\r\nProf Edith Vries, Director-General, DAFF,&nbsp; explained that the Department&rsquo;s response was based on the theme of the State of the Nation Address (SONA) which was &ldquo;Growing the Economy&rdquo; and as it was captured in the President&rsquo;s statement that &ldquo;The year 2015 is the Year of the Freedom Charter and Unity in Action to Advance Economic Freedom&rdquo;. &nbsp;The current contribution of agriculture to economic growth and job creation was far below the potential of the sector. It was therefore no surprise that the President identified Agriculture as &ldquo;a catalyst for growth and food security&rdquo; and announced the revitalising of agriculture and the agro-processing value chain as one of the nine point plan to ignite growth and create jobs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHer first area of focus was on job creation in the sector. The decision to isolate Agriculture as a growth sector was because Agriculture delivers more jobs per Rand invested than any other productive sector, and also remained critical in the face of rural poverty and food insecurity. The National Development Plan (NDP) estimated that Agriculture could potentially create 1 million jobs by 2030. However, the conditions for meeting this target included a focus on high growth commodities, in combination with improved delivery on land reforms and improved livelihoods within communal areas. DAFF was determined that in the near future the South African people would begin to derive the benefits of its direct interventions to encourage investment in the Agriculture and Agro-processing value chain. Progress was already being made in this regard. The latest STATSSA Quarterly Labour Force Survey confirmed that Agriculture contributed the greatest number of employees at 56 000 quarter on quarter and sustained increases in job creation year on year of 28 000. DAFF is confident that this number would grow as it institutionalises the Agricultural Policy Action Plan (APAP) and significantly increases the production of strategic commodities by smallholder producers. DAFF also has a number of initiatives to bring new entrants into the sector. For example, DAFF&rsquo;s bursary scheme which was introduced in 2003 has produced over 1 000 graduates. None of the recipients of DAFF&rsquo;s bursaries are unemployed as they were either brought into the Department for an internship or deployed to DAFF&rsquo;s entities or into commodity groups. The bursary scheme also targets Grade 11 and 12 learners at rural schools and in the Western Cape. DAFF would be funding 65 learners this year, 20 of which are at two Senior Secondary schools in De Doorns. In the 2015/16 financial year, DAFF would develop and implement a strategy to identify and deploy graduates from agriculture colleges to APAP and land reforms farms and projects.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHer second area of focus was on the Agricultural Policy Action Plan (APAP). At the SONA, the President stated that the government was working with the private sector to develop an APAP that would bring one million hectares of under-utilised land into full production over the next three years. Ms Vries was pleased to inform the Committee that the APAP had been recommended to Cabinet for approval by the Economic Sector, Employment and Infrastructure Development Cabinet Committee two days prior to the Committee meeting. The APAP is a set of detailed actions with timeframes, which would revitalise the Agriculture and Agro-processing value-chain. The APAP sought to translate the high-level responses offered in the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Strategic Framework into tangible, concrete steps and actions. However, this first iteration of APAP would not be offered as a fully comprehensive plan but on the model of the Industrial Policy Action Plan (&lsquo;IPAP&rsquo;), as it identified an ambitious but manageable number of focused actions in anticipation of future APAP iterations. The Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Strategic Framework spell out a vision for more equitable, productive, competitive and sustainable growth. In doing so it outlines key policy areas or policy pillars, including Equity and transformation, equitable growth and competitiveness, environmental sustainability and good governance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo implement the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Strategic Framework, APAP outlined a value chain approach in which it identified priority commodities. The selection criteria of commodities, as identified in the National Development Plan, included those with high growth potential, and high labour absorption like fruits and more specifically citrus. DAFF further added some other commodities with the potential to contribute to a positive trade balance. These are Red Meat, Poultry, Fruit and Vegetables, Sugar, Wine, Wheat, Forestry, Fisheries and Aquaculture and Bio-fuels. She added that there was likely to be a public debate on the selection of these commodities as each industry had canvassed for the inclusion of their commodity in the APAP. It must however be noted that the identified commodities were consulted on through an inclusive process with Commodity Organizations, State Owned Enterprises, Provincial Departments, and Other National Departments. Also included in the APAP were transversal Key Action Programmes addressing cross-cutting matter including: Fetsa Tlala &ndash; our production response; Climate Smart Agriculture which was proposed as an alternative to capital intensive modes of production; Trade, Agri-Business Development and Support, Bio-security, SIP11, and Research and Innovation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach of the Key Action Programmes in the APAP defined: the Problem Statement in the context of achieving more inclusive growth, and growth constraints that must be; Aspirations, which defines set targets to meet objectives; Required Policy Levers, and Key Outputs in achieving the set aspirations. For example one of the problem statements on poultry included: Consumption of white meat is expected to expand by 34%. This increase was supplemented through high levels of imports especially low-cost frozen portions. Other problem statements on poultry could be sighted in the presentation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDAFF is therefore enabled to formulate a preliminary impact statement with a view that with all conditions favourable, APAP could by 2019 potentially: Increase in number of smallholder producers from 164 000 in 2012 to 400&nbsp;500, Increase value added of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (AFF) from R42,5 billion in 2012 to R48,9 billion in 2019 &ndash; a 2% real growth per year, real increase in value of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries net exports from an annual average of R5,1 billion in 2012 to R5,8 billion in 2019 &ndash; a 2% real growth per year, decrease in value of diesel, fertiliser and machinery imports at an annual average of R9,6 billion in 2012 to R7,4 billion - a 3% real decline per year, reduction in the share of households experiencing hunger from 10,8% of households in 2012 to 8,0% of households in 2019 and an increase in number of jobs in Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries from 660 000 average for 2012 to 822 500 which is an additional 162 500 jobs and a potential 1 million jobs by 2030.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Inclusion of smallholder farmers in the Agricultural Economy was the third point that the DG highlighted. Prof Vries informed the Committee that the measurement of numbers and tracking of the performance of the number of smallholder producers would be improved over the next two years. At present smallholders were statistically unknown and there was no uniformity in the definitions and categorisation of different categories of farmers. This Comprehensive Framework on Producer Support was therefore an important project that DAFF proposes to complete by the middle of 2015/16. Through APAP, DAFF aims to bring more smallholders into the mainstream as envisaged in the National Development Plan, however, the effective participation of the previously excluded black majority in agriculture and food production would only occur meaningfully, when they have access to land and the means to work it. An inclusive and scientific process would be used to assess the situation in terms of land capability for different commodities and in different localities, so as to inform land acquisition and allocation for different categories of producers across the country.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Vhembe District Municipality in Musina for example, Limpopo Government has supported the Nwanedi Cluster comprising 300 farmers growing vegetables on just over 1,300 hectares for commercial purposes. The Cluster had already created more than 2,500 jobs as vegetable farming is highly labour-intensive. This project would be intensified and an additional 1,200 hectares would increase land under production over the MTEF period. The expansion of the project would include the establishment of a Logistics and Agro-processing hub that would allow these farmers to add further value to their crops. DAFF, through the Province, would invest R100m over the MTEF period to leverage growth of the private sector in this Cluster. In the 2015/16 financial year, DAFF would directly invest R20m for bulk-water supply and in-field irrigation. Such initiatives going forward would become a reality in the 27 priority district municipalities such as Alfred Nzo and Sekhukhune. Lives would be changed for the better as market access for smallholder farmers, leverage private-sector investment in Agro-processing and provide technical support to smallholder farmers is created.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe DG also touched on the contribution of Agriculture to the GDP. The President reported that Agro-processing exports had been growing rapidly especially to new markets in Africa and China. For example after 5-years of technical work on the resolving the phyto-sanitary requirements, agricultural trade protocols for the export of South African Maize and Apples to China was concluded. Export of apples alone has been projected to generate R500 million in foreign exchange and thus the industry is gearing up to plant an additional 10,000 hectares thereby creating 13,000 new jobs over the next 3-5 years because it takes at least 3 years before new apple trees begin to bear fruit. The APAP included the deployment of a range of policy and financial resources to bring 1 million hectares of under-utilised land into full production over the next 5 years. This included 238,000 hectares for Soya bean production and expanding the over 100 000 hectares which was currently under production across the country through the Festa Tlala programme. The Festa Tlala programme finds its expression in many projects such as the Diyatalawa Community Property Association (CPA) in the Maluti-a-Phofung in the Free State, comprising of 51 beneficiaries, which has planted 553 hectares of maize and 200 hectares of beans. Another example given was of Mrs. Maria Mlungu who planted 116ha of maize that was sold through the World Food Programme Initiative. In the 2013/14 DIRCO donated R180 million to the World Food Programme towards humanitarian assistance to ameliorate the impact of the drought in the Kingdom of Lesotho. Through this initiative 268 metric tons of white maize was procured from smallholder producers in 2013/14 and 4 300 metric tons of both white maize and sugar bean in the current financial year 2014/15 from smallholder producers in Eastern Cape, North West and Gauteng Province. This initiative confirmed that as long as commodities produced by smallholders met the standards of the World Food Programme, there was no reason to exclude smallholders from other local and international market opportunities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother area of attention was the strengthening and alignment of DAFF&rsquo;s public entities, the Agricultural Research Council (ARC): and the National Agricultural Marketing Council (NAMC) in particular, which has been actively involved in the development of APAP over the past 18-months. The research and data bases from the ARCs Soil Testing Laboratories were used in the spatial analysis and maps which were developed to determine which commodities could be produced in which places. Currently DAFF is enhancing these maps with data from other government departments on water sources and economic development zones. DAFF had also been working with ARC to develop a business case, which could be presented to National Treasury for consideration in the next budget cycle for multi-year funding to develop new cultivars or vaccines or undertake other critical research. DAFF is aware of the directive to review the location of key public entities, in line with the recommendations of the report on the Review of State owned entities. The ARC is therefore currently undergoing an external evaluation. This is an institutionalised process for all science councils that took place every 5 years. The outcomes of this evaluation would be communicated to the Committee when available. The National Agricultural Marketing Council (NAMC) also supported the APAP with economic analysis and their expertise in value chain mapping. Furthermore, NAMC is the coordinator for Strategic Infrastructure Project 11 that pertains to Agro Logistics and Rural Infrastructure. The Perishable Products Export Control Board (PPECB) has committed to expand the number of smallholder farmers with SA GAP Certification. Similarly the Land Bank would also expand the number of smallholders benefiting from its services. DAFF was also working with Onderstepoort Biological Products (OBP) on a business case to secure funding to ramp up vaccine production.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe budget was a crucial focus touched on by Prof Vries. In the current financial year the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation reported to the Committee that DAFF&rsquo;s targets were below the projections in the NDP. DAFF has had a severe budget cut of over R230 million in 2015/16 and similar cuts in subsequent years. In the context of the 2015 Estimates of National Expenditure, there is a worrying trend in that whilst the majority of departments enjoyed significant increases or budget cuts below 100%, DAFF was the only department that received a cut of minus 309.4%. If DAFF did not have the budget to implement the entire inspirational and widely supported programme, the above listed impact would not be realised. DAFF had not had the time to interrogate the data and would therefore like to undertake some of this analysis and share it with the Committee over the next few days. An excerpt &ndash; (Table 5 &ndash; Amounts to be appropriated from the national Revenue Fund for 2015/16) listing the budget cuts and increases was circulated for the attention of the members.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><em>Discussion</em></strong><br />\r\nMr T Ramokhoase (ANC) emphasised that the Committee was still in dire need of the Integrated Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Plan as it would enable the Committee to assess whether the Department was on the right track or not. Monitoring by the Department should be at the backbone of their efforts and not a once and for all endeavour. It was encouraging that the relevant protocols have been concluded with other international countries, however, he asked DAFF to indicate the farmers that would be beneficiaries of the programme so that the effectiveness and target area be assessed. He asked whether DAFF could indicate any structure that had benefited from the NAMC in getting markets for their products because, scanning through KZN, Johannesburg, Eastern Cape and Gauteng, he had not come across any structure that had signified their benefiting from the scheme. Assistance given by DAFF must reflect over time a relative decrease in poverty among the farmers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs A Steyn (DA) was excited that it seemed for the first time in a long time she was seeing a ray of light as regards the Department. However, some realities had to be taken into consideration. There was a need for the Committee to get a presentation from the Portfolio Committee on Rural Development and Land Reforms on the implications of the proposed plans for land reforms. People were getting extremely negative as innovative ideas were constantly being brought up but the farmers were not given the space to grow their industry despite the large amounts of land available in the market. She pointed out that even some farmers had complained of being threatened if they did not comply with laid down rules. She emphasised that it was crucial for the Minister to be summoned to the Committee to give responses to some policy issues. The agreement with China was a laudable step but could South Africa achieve its aim of importation of maize to China with the impact of the drought? What disaster plan did DAFF have in place to curb the impact of the drought? She had recently received phone calls from farmers that would want to put their farms up for sale because they could not service the debt. If many farmers may not plant next year, the country should then imagine what would happen the year after. On the examples of the successful projects mentioned by the DG in her presentation and the plans that had been put in place going forward, she was interested in knowing how long it would take for implementation in provinces as it had been observed in the past that so many resources had been spent on projects with no obvious results though few successes had been seen. How would funds expended on these new projects be monitored to ensure that it produced the maximum benefit? The Department should liaise with commercial farmers on a 50/50 project to implement land reforms in the fallow areas and where the failed irrigation programmes existed as many of the projects that had succeeded were as a result of a private/public partnership.&nbsp; Furthermore, most farmers had a signed agreement with a bank or a coop as most of them did not have cash to plant, therefore the loan must first be repaid before the farmer could assess his profit. DAFF must therefore work with markets massively to ensure that small-time farmers grow because the market is the key.&nbsp; She gave an illustration of a potato farmer that had to leave the huge number of potatoes in the ground to rot because the amount that would cost them to harvest and take the potatoes to the market was too enormous and could not afford it as it would lead to a loss.&nbsp; She was optimistic that if all these issues could be dealt with and strengths harnessed, agriculture could be the game changer for South Africa. She expressed her concerns about the budget cut of the Department.&nbsp; What was the reason for the cut? Could it be because of the mismanagement of the previous year&rsquo;s budget? It is essential to note that DAFF may not receive a bigger budget if there was no realistic plan to judiciously appropriate the funds given.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Z Mandela (ANC) reiterated that DAFF was the worst Department in terms of loss as regards the budget cuts. He was interested to know the reasons for the drastic cut of the budget. Could it be an indication of the failure of the Department regarding spending or in reaching out to the people and also in ensuring that their programmes were implemented as quickly as possible? What was the Department doing regarding vast amounts of land that were lying fallow and unutilised for example in the Eastern Cape? How is the Department ensuring that young people especially from rural communities were prioritised and given bursaries so that they could use the land? How could young people afford themselves of DAFF&rsquo;s bursaries and internships? He had noticed that in Butterworth and its environs, so much maize had been planted, who planted the maize, was it the Department of Rural Development and Land Reforms or was it DAFF? He wished to understand why at times the Department of Rural Development and Land Reforms were carrying out the work that should be done or spearheaded by DAFF. Why should the Department of Rural Development and Land Reforms front the programmes that should be fronted by DAFF? He gave examples of some communities where these had occurred. He gave an illustration of the Mandela School of Science and Technology that was opened in January 2014 by the State President and being funded by Siemens as one of the State of the Art schools established in rural South Africa. The funding by Siemens was to ensure that modern technology was not foreign to the rural community and young people were trained and educated in the field of agriculture. Did DAFF have programmes in place that could assist it in partnering with such agricultural schools especially to aid the students to find work afterwards? How could young people gain access to internship programmes? Who could be contacted at the Department? This information should be disseminated to young people as they were in need of such information.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr M Filtane (UDM) voiced his frustration regarding employment creation and proposed that DAFF start a programme that would absorb young people into the Department for 3 years, after which the students would be released to start their own agricultural enterprise. This step could curb the incessant long list of applicants into the Department. The stakeholders and institutions mentioned by the DG in her presentation did not appear to factor in the public in their operations. To what extent has DAFF consulted with the general public in this regard? With respect to the high costs of animal feed prices, he wanted to know why South Africa could not produce its own feed. What is the principal constraining factor for this?&nbsp; It was noted in the presentation that there was an increase in the number of smallholder producers from 164 000 to 400&nbsp;500, are these producers profitable? Information received shows that many of these smallholder producers were still operating but they were not happy and were far from profitable. He insisted that if a business is not profitable, there was no reason to keep it going. He understood the process of land acquisition; however, how and where DAFF would get suitable lands appears to be a problem especially for the kind of production being envisaged. On budget management, he reminded DAFF that the Department had conceded in another report that its monitoring and evaluation strategies were ineffective; it would therefore be reckless for National treasury to increase the Departments budget when the Department itself had acknowledged this hitch. It made a lot of sense for the budget to be reduced as long as the Department constantly proves that it cannot manage public finance.&nbsp; It had been observed based on previous Committee oversight, that some officials had deliberately lied or misrepresented facts and figures. This meant that reports given could not be relied upon. The action was also a criminal offence. He appealed to the DG to deal decisively with such matters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr P Mabe (ANC) agreed with Ms Steyn that agriculture could be a game changer in the economy but his most worrying factor was the budget cut. The budget cut would make it quite difficult to implement the prescripts of APAP by the Department.&nbsp; The Department had linked its goals to about 3 outcomes in the National Development Plan, which were outcomes 4, 7 and 10.&nbsp; Outcome 7 was involved with rural development and food security so the Department of Rural Development and Land Reforms may tend to think that they are the ones that should spearhead such function and even outcome 10 was on the management of environmental assets and resources which would make the Department of Environmental Affairs believe that they should be in charge of the project. Issues like this should be better channelled by the DAFF. The Department could not drive the robust programme of food security if it did not give the people the seeds to plant and if it did not maximise the use of productive land. DAFF should present to the Committee its own attempts to make the agricultural sector sustainable especially in the face of drought and no irrigation systems. He pointed out the concept of water harvesting.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr C Maxegwana (ANC) emphasised that surely there were reasons for the budget cut. If DAFF were not doing the right things, then the other Departments that have been linked to DAFF would take over its responsibilities and make DAFF inconsequential. The 2&nbsp;500 jobs created by DAFF were not sustainable jobs.&nbsp; DAFF must endeavour to create sustainable jobs in agriculture for the rural communities so that generations after would be well catered for. He wanted to know why the agricultural school in Middelburg in Grootfontein seemed neglected. As it is an agricultural school that DAFF is responsible for, the Committee must of necessity schedule an oversight visit to the school.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe statement made by Mr Maxegwana on the Middleburg Agricultural College was widely applauded by the members.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Z Jongbloed (DA) also expressed deep concern about the budget cut and the probable reasons for it. She was concerned about the effect it could have on Fisheries. Last year the President commissioned Operation PHAKISA &ndash; to unlock the wealth of the ocean but she had always imagined where the funds for its implementation would come from. In view of the budget cut, the Committee needed to be reassured by the Department that it would not just put plans to paper without any implementation mechanism in place. Was operation PHAKISA still on track? Her second source of concern was the rollout of the small-scale fisheries plan. Deliberating with the fishing communities along the coasts, she observed that they had been experiencing huge problems with trust, transparency, corruption and such. The first implementation date for the rollout of the small scale fisheries plan was June 2014 but in a meeting held in December, it was communicated that the roll out would be in June 2015, but further information received has shown that the roll out would only be expected to kick off next year as there was still much to be done. There is a lot of expectation from the coastal communities, as the plans were perceived as a solution to poverty. She asked whether DAFF had the money for the rollout of these programmes and was able to meet the deadlines that had been set, as it could not afford to waste resources at this point. One of the biggest problems that the fishing communities had been witnessing since the Interim Relief System started was that the list had not been made accessible to the people in the communities even though the Minister had assured that anybody could have access to them. There was a need for transparency regarding the fishery plan.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson insisted that DAFF give the Committee a feedback on the Middelburg Agricultural School. The ongoing engagement by the Committee and the Department was geared towards the finalisation of the APPs and the Committee&rsquo;s expectation must be clearly communicated to the Department especially when interacting with the official documents that would make DAFF account to the Department on a quarterly basis. If DAFF did not take up her responsibilities, other Departments would. For example the issue of the database for small time farmers had been left hanging for too long, and DAFF must be proactive in getting it in place. 30% of the state budget which supposed to benefit small holder farmers is left, therefore DAFF must come up with programmes which would link the small holder farmers to schools, hospitals and correctional services. The rates of the Land Bank should be reconsidered. The Land Bank is a developmental bank and therefore rates should not be charged like other commercial banks. She reminded the members that there was an outstanding meeting with the Minister of Finance and Minister of Agriculture regarding this. She wanted to know what steps DAFF had taken towards the disappearing money, as those monies were loans that were to be awarded to other people. She commended the Department for the identification of commodities. It was a right approach; however, as DAFF identifies them, transformation agendas must be put in place. Treasury must be called upon to justify and create an understanding of the budget cut. It is also essential that the person that is dealing with the DAFF budget must be present in Portfolio Committee meetings, as this would ensure a better understanding by the treasury of what is at stake. She told the DG that her responses should exclude issues on accountability and fisheries, as these issues would be dealt with extensively on the 6 and the 10 March.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nResponding, Prof Vries confirmed that DAFF also shared the same concerns as the Committee members regarding the budget cut. She and the team were just waiting for the appropriate time to deliberate with National Treasury on the matter. She explained that since August 2014, DAFF, National Treasury, the Department of Rural Development and Land Reforms and the Land Bank had been involved in several meetings and workshops. One of the aims of these engagements was to make sure that relevant departments work together and effectively apply their budget.&nbsp; Another reason was to ensure that every Department used their budget for their mandates so that duplication of efforts could be minimized and resources could be used more effectively. DAFF and the Department of Rural Development and Land Reforms had been working together and had come up with an Integrated Funding Model to eliminate duplications from within both departments. Members had to have a better understanding of the mandate of each entity, as it would assist the members to have reasonable expectations from the entities. NAMC&rsquo;s mandate is not to support smallholders; it is an agricultural board set up to advise the Minister on marketing issues whilst the ARC&rsquo;s mandate is not to plant but to be involved in research. It would therefore be essential that the mandates of entities must be clarified.&nbsp; DAFF has derived extreme lessons from the World Food Programme, one of which is that DAFF must not deal with individual farmers but pool them in few numbers together into cooperatives. The Department was able to put together 18 coops in the first year. It is a wrong assumption to think that DAFF would drive the whole value chain; however it is the people in the Department of Small Businesses that had the enterprise to do this. DAFF is well aware of the drought and its effect especially in the provinces where it has impacted on the crops. South Africa would not be able to export maize and may even have to import a small percentage, however, NIMC would advise the Minister on the current import prices vis-a-vis the local prices. She explained that the Department did not have the intention that its projects to fail. She pointed out that even several projects that succeeded had failed at one time or the other, however on the issue of the APAP; it had been approached with the best scientific method available at the Department&rsquo;s disposal. Some DAFF officials had just spent two days each in all the provinces so as to understand the peculiarity of each province and to put on the table the most effective business plan. It was true that sometimes there were inconsistencies in the reporting of DAFF&rsquo;s officials and this happened many times because what put on paper was not what was necessarily implemented.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Ramokhoase interrupted the DG with the permission of the Chairperson. He expressed his annoyance on the responses given by the DG; most of her responses were not impressive. Members understood the issue of different mandates and concurrence and were not uninformed as to what they represented. These issues would have to be trashed at a later and more appropriate time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe Chairperson asked the DG to briefly round up her responses. She advised that issues that needed more dialogue be suspended to the subsequent week.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe DG finalised her statement and handed over to the DDG, Food Security and Agrarian Reform.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Joe Kuobokoe, DDG, Food Security and Agrarian Reform (FSAR) commented on two areas that were the internships and the bursary scheme of the Department. He emphasised that everything revolved around the budget; therefore, the budget is the major constraint to proper implementation of these two strategic programmes. He explained that each governmental department is supposed to recruit a number of interns annually equal to 5% of its staff compliment. DAFF has a little over 7000 employed staff members therefore 5% of that will be a little over 300 and obviously the Department would not have enough budget for that, so on an annual basis, the Department is supposed to recruit around 300 interns. DAFF has a popular accredited and transparent system of recruiting agricultural graduates. Advertisement is made around August every year. Recruitment exercise is carried out about December every year and the successful candidates resume 1 February each year. The applications were always so overwhelming out of which a minimal number of 250 interns would be employed because of the budget limitations. The bursary scheme on the other hand provided comprehensive funding to young people. When DAFF promotes its agricultural programmes and the interested young people apply, those that meet the necessary requirements would be funded to Universities and Universities of Technology. This funding is very expensive and included all the needs of the student including books, meals, accommodation and tuition. These students are sent to learn critical and scarce skills in agriculture. Another initiative of the Department was to target children on farm schools. DAFF recently embarked on a college revitalisation plan that would be funded by National Treasury. On an annual basis, certain number of millions would be allocated to these colleges. There were only 12 colleges of agriculture with one in Groenfontein named Groenfontein Agricultural Development Institute. The college is being treated as one of the directorates in the Department. The history of the college is well known that it lies between the Eastern and the Northern Cape. After 1994, there were contestations between the two provinces; the Department then took over the college. Each of these colleges is given a yearly budget. The Zolo College was reopened this year. It was previously closed down because its programmes lost accreditation. However for the first time because of revitalisation, the college would be recruiting students that would be trained in Para-veterinarian. DAFF has a database of smallholder farmers, however more work is needed on expanding the database so that it could cover majority of the smallholder farmers. He also assumed that all the issues raised by the members on schools were about colleges of agriculture, the country also has schools of Agriculture, however, these schools report back to the Department of Basic Education but most of the feedbacks received from these schools were not good stories to tell.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson suggested that at the next meeting the DG could share with the members the Integrated Funding Model. The DG was asked to commence with the next presentation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Progress Report on the Alignment of Services between the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and Its Entities and Provinces, 27 February 2015 </strong><br />\r\nThe Director General of DAFF, Prof Vries, furthermore reported on the progress of the alignment of services between the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and its Entities and Provinces. Government delivers services to citizens through two main machineries of state - directly through government departments (at national, provincial or local spheres) and through public entities (including associated institutions and state owned entities). There are currently five Public Entities reporting to the Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, namely the Agricultural Research Council (ARC), Perishable Products Export Control Board (PPECB), National Agricultural Marketing Council (NAMC), Onderstepoort Biological Products (OBP) and NCERA farms. There are currently possible misalignment and duplication of effort between what the DAFF does and what its Public Entities and the Provincial Departments of Agriculture (PDAs) do. Through the Medium Term Strategic Framework (MTSF) and the implementation of the Agricultural Policy Action Plan (APAP) the misalignment and the duplication were being addressed. The MTSF and APAP having been informed by the National Development Plan (NDP), force the machineries of government to work together instead of working against each other and duplicating efforts. The APAP environmental scan looked at the sector as a whole and identified what needed to be done, what it would cost, where and who would drive and who would support. APAP Implementation Plans were also on track and would be implemented from 1 April 2015.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe current duplication of effort between the ARC and the Research Directorate in the DAFF and between the NAMC and the Marketing Directorate in the DAFF were highlighted by the DG. NAMC was established in terms of the Marketing of Agriculture Products Act, No 47 of 1996, as an advisory body to provide strategic advice to the Minister on all agricultural marketing issues, to improve market efficiency and market access by all participants, to optimise export earnings, and to improve the viability of the agricultural sector. As part of executing its mandate derived from the Act, NAMC has in certain circumstances duplicated the work carried out by the Department in broad areas such as trade, marketing support, livestock development programmes, etc. The Department noted the duplication and initiated a process of collaboration to eliminate the overlaps and streamline the functions between the Department and the NAMC on matters relating to agricultural marketing. This issue of the clarification of the roles and responsibilities between the Department and the NAMC would further be clarified in the Marketing Act that is currently undergoing a review.<br />\r\nThe areas of duplication between the Directorate: Policy Research Support and the ARC were:-<br />\r\nDiagnostic services including the rendering of tests and/or identification for genetic material - DAFF has a Directorate for this purpose with infrastructure in various parts of the country to perform diagnostic services. The ARC, on the other hand, maintains laboratories and related infrastructure for similar purposes. There is a need to harmonize and integrate the provision of these services to avoid duplication.<br />\r\nForesight and Economic Research - There is a glaring gap in the services and focus of the ARC related to economic research to the extent that the Department sources this service most often from the Universities, and to a limited extent from the NAMC on some aspects.<br />\r\nResearch Frameworks and Agenda - This is the competency of the DAFF, and the current ARC Act is being amended to rectify the conflict.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe PPECB and the OBP&rsquo;s functions compliment what the Branch: Agricultural Production, Health and Food Safety in the DAFF is doing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe current duplication of effort between the Department and the PDAs is in the following areas:-<br />\r\nSupport to smallholder farmers, which takes place at grassroots level.<br />\r\nTechnology Transfer and Extension Services - The DAFF and the PDAs provide funding Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) for the recruitment of extension officials as well as the provision of technology transfer and extension services. The ARC also has the mandate to provide technology transfer to farming communities for the technologies they develop. More often there is conflict when the ARC officials provide services in the Provinces without the involvement of the PDA officials, who are mandated to provide direct support for agrarian development.<br />\r\nMonitoring &amp; Evaluation of conditional grant projects is often inadequate and one of the PDAs biggest areas of double reporting is the requests from the DAFF and Department of Rural Development and Land Reform (DRDLR,) which were not always synchronized.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe lack of a national framework has created unnecessary confusion with regard to the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders, the nature of services they are meant to provide, the gaps that exist and a guide for appropriate packages of support per category of producer. DAFF is therefore in the process of developing a framework on norms and standards for producer support which would be primarily focused on financial and technical non-financial support to address the gaps that exist where support is provided by a myriad of stakeholders, including government departments, without a national framework. There are task teams established through the APAP process and two of the task teams amongst others are for Research and Innovation and for Market Access. The composition of the task teams is made up of the DAFF, DRDLR, ARC and NAMC. These task teams would plan together and share responsibilities that would address the issue of duplication and misalignment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo promote synergy between the DAFF, Public Entities and Provinces, DAFF had recently developed an integrated planning framework, which defined the collaboration of activities between DAFF, Provinces and Public Entities. The framework defined how strategic planning processes and reporting should be undertaken between DAFF and these role-players. It spelt out how the DAFF should take a lead in informing the Public Entities on Priority Areas since their mandates were derived from DAFF. This framework would be implemented fully from 1 April 2015. The Deputy Director Generals (DDGs) of DAFF were also allocated to Provinces and Public Entities to ensure adherence to performance with respect to government policy and priorities. This would greatly assist in identifying areas of misalignment and duplication. The DDGs would ensure that the Department engages with the detail of the annual budget and corporate plans of the Public Entities and Provinces with the purpose of preparing advice to the Minister on the subject matter. The Annual Reports of the Public Entities would also be submitted to the Director-General for submission to the Minister. The Director General would meet with the Head of Department (HODs) and the Chief Executives Officers (CEOs) of the Public Entities at MINTECH on a quarterly basis to discuss implementation of the plans and to prepare for MINMEC, where necessary.<br />\r\nThe Director-General would also meet with the CEOs of the Public Entities quarterly to discuss matters of operational performance. Each Public Entity would submit to the Director-General of the Department an annual budget and corporate plan contemplated in Chapter 6 of the Public Finance Management Act, 1999 (Act No. 1 of 1999), Strategic objectives and outcomes identified and agreed on; Strategic business initiatives; Key performance measures and indicators; Risk management plans; Fraud prevention strategy and plan; and Financial plan reflecting revenue and expenditure projections and balance sheet management for onward submission to the Minister.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><em>Discussion</em></strong><br />\r\nThe Chairperson asked whether there were other issues that the Department would want to notify the Committee on especially on transformation issues, AgriBEE and the Forestry Charter.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Elaine Alexander, DDG, Economic Development, Trade Development of DAFF reminded the Committee members that for a while now, there had been a number of issues around the Forestry Sector Charter Council which warranted the need for an Executive Director to be appointed to drive, she was therefore pleased to inform the members that on the 1 of January 2015, an Executive Director was appointed and all the subsequent issues therefore, would be driven through the Executive Director.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson replied that the step taken was good news that was well appreciated.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Director General added the other outstanding issues that were the Forestry Special Analysis and an update on the Finalisation of the National Policy on Extension and Advisory Services. She had given a presentation on the National Policy on Extension and Advisory Services to the Committee towards the end of last year<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson refuted the statement. She insisted that the presentation was still outstanding and that the presentation must be given on 10 March as part of the quarterly report.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn remembered that towards the end of last year, there was an attempt by the Department to make presentation but the presentation was postponed. However, she could not remember what presentation it was.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Ramokhoase commented on the annexure to the documents distributed to the members. Having gone through the annexure, it was important for the Committee to engage with DAFF on the issues raised. He proposed that by the next meeting, the Department must come with the actual in their annexure as that would assist the members and curb backward discussions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson supported the comment. She told the DG that when the Committee requested information, specifics must be given and not general knowledge. All outstanding issues including the Extensions and Advisory Services, Fisheries and the NAMC presentations would be presented on 6 and 10 March. She insisted that the programme be forwarded to the Minister, as it was important for him to be present.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Integrated Spatial Analysis on land capability and land use for Agriculture and Forestry, 27 February 2015</strong><br />\r\nMr Mmaphaka Tau, Acting Deputy Director General of Forestry and Natural Resources Management presented the Integrated Spatial Analysis on land capability and land use for Agriculture and Forestry to the Committee. He touched on food security and the production challenge, land capability assessment, classification and evaluation and the preservation and development of Agricultural Land.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe South African food production challenge and a steep decline in the area of High Value Agricultural Land available for crop production in South Africa had persisted. The current DAFF estimate was less than 0.25 ha per person per annum. He presented a chart that indicated the South Africa&rsquo;s food production challenge vis-a-vis the granted prospecting and mining rights per province. The chart reflected that many of the High Value Agricultural Land &ndash; HVAL had been issued on mining rights.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nHe defined Land Capability as the extent to which land could meet the needs of one or more uses, under defined conditions of management, without permanent damage, the expression of effects of physical factors on the total suitability and potential for use for: Crops that requires regular tillage; Grazing; Forestry and Wildlife. Land capability involves consideration of the risks of damage from erosion and other causes; the difficulties in land-use caused by physical factors, including climate - rain-fed production; and the production potential. He touched on the 2014 Land Capability Evaluation System that started April 2014. In the 2014 / 15 financial year, issues of National climate, soil, terrain and land capability models were dealt with in Mpumalanga, Western Cape and the Eastern Cape. The 2015/16 financial year would deal with the outstanding 6 provinces and the Integrated Geo-database.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Tau enumerated the advantages of the 2014 Land Capability Evaluation. He presented the 2014 Land Capability Evaluation System, the Agricultural Potential Zones Conceptual Diagram, the fully<br />\r\nIntegrated National Geo-referenced Database and all the facets of agricultural land use planning- crops, forestry, animal adaptability, agro-ecosystems management, environmental risk and impact assessments, land degradation risk assessment, framework for future monitoring, climate change, etc. He also highlighted the Draft Framework Policy and Bill on the Preservation and Development of Agricultural Land which included Spatial planning &ndash; Suitability modelling and Spatial zoning and associated regulations - Primary Food Production Zones.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Tau concluded that there was a continued decline in High Value Agricultural Land with the major drivers being: Population growth, Urbanisation and related infrastructure and Mining. The advantages of spatial analysis and modelling regarding Land Capability, Land Suitability and Land Use were: Quantifying spatial impacts in relation to food production, Provision of a more refined spatial dataset for integrated planning and Primary Food Production Zones and associated regulations per zone will guide development patterns in a proactive manner<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><em>Discussion</em></strong><br />\r\nThe Chairperson reminded the members of legislation passed last year by the Department of Rural Development and Land Reforms called SPULMA. iIt would have been auspicious if the same opportunity had been used to secure a relevant bill for agricultural land.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nMs Steyn recalled that at the time of SPLUMA bill, there were discussions around agricultural land; however she had been informed that there was another bill in place that could regulate the issues of the land vis-a-vis agricultural land. However, it is evident that another bill that would speak specifically to the classification of land and the high value of agricultural land is essential. She expressed her utmost concerns regarding the huge amount of land that the country had lost to mining and even more outrageous is the fact that these lands could no longer be used for agricultural purposes. It is important to note that agricultural lands must be protected at all costs because the people cannot eat gold.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Jongbloed agreed that preservation of agricultural land was very crucial but proceeds from the forest were equally important. In 2005, there was a study that showed that by 2015, 800&nbsp;000 hectares of land would have been reforested. What progress had been made so far regarding this?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Filtane wanted to know whether the public had access to this kind of information. The Department must think of a systematic way of notifying the public of what type of land was needed to produce what as this information would enhance proper decision-making. Before mining rights are issued, are consultations made with the Department and could the Department either endorse or raise an objection as to the siting of a mining facility.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn, on the Land Care Programme, asked why this kind of information could not be used by the Department to facilitate the Department to put laudable programmes in place to ameliorate the situation at hand.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson confirmed that the presentation was an informative one but that a lot of work still had to be done to gain proper understanding of the concepts. A policy that would secure the land in the meantime could be passed. As much as the report presented was appreciated, the report did not propose what could be done to curb this land wastage so that the economy could be effectively grown. She suggested that the information shared with the Committee should also be shared with the Department of Mineral Resources.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Tau alluded to the comments made by Members regarding competing developments eating deeper and deeper into agricultural lands. Currently, the mandate of the subdivision on agricultural land does not make provision to comment on whether a land could be used for mining purposes or not. This is therefore a real challenge. Some of these concerns had been shared with the Department of Mineral Resources and they had also shared their plans to regulate the encumbrance of land for mining to accommodate more agricultural land use. However, there were still communal areas where the subdivision of land did not apply which meant that the act could not be enforced. On afforestation, the Western Cape, Limpopo and Mpumalanga have been identified and about a 100 000&nbsp;&nbsp; hectares of land had been identified in the Eastern Cape and KZN but this was also subject to water licensing. Proper processes are in place with the Department of Water and Sanitation to facilitate the achievement of the objective. In provinces, DAFF has officials Resource Auditors and they are responsible for the conservation of Agricultural Resources Act. They organise awareness programmes and the Department encourages them to include subdivision issues or change of land issues during these awareness programmes. These Resource Auditors also comment on how to manage degradation from the agricultural point of view, however they cannot effect any decision as to whether a land is used or not.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Filtane appreciated the explanation given. He passionately emphasised that the time had come where DAFF must bring to the attention of Cabinet the serious consequences going forward of what was happening. As a nation, millions could not be battling to have food on their table and we would accept a situation where mining activities would reduce the amount of productive land that could be used for agricultural purposes. There is a need to use these lands to produce the number one basic need of the people, which is food. Mining is a secondary need. This Committee must also conceptualise a legislation that would give the Department exceptional rights that would make the agricultural need of a land supersede that of mining. These decisions need to be made across party lines because food is a primary concern.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe DG clarified the date for the presentation of the APAP to the Committee. She also emphasised that APAP was somehow above DAFF because it is an intergovernmental revitalisation of agriculture. It was just that DAFF was the driving agent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn raised her concerns regarding the realignment between the different entities. How did the different entities link up into DAFF? Would DAFF refer to these entities in its annual financial reports when a project was carried out by another entity? She wanted clarifications on who spearheaded the development of a new vaccine for example or who was responsible for the new research for a drought resilient crop.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Ramokhoase replied vehemently that there was no need to worry about who was in charge of what, the main issue was the product that must be delivered. The when, where and how was more important. With regards to pronouncements, DAFF must consult the relevant resolutions and must ensure that more people are not sought to do the work. More people would cause more waste but less people could get the work done faster.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson reminded the DG that these issues on alignment had been previously raised but had not been sorted out. As much as the members understood the mandates of each entity, it has been observed that NAMC that is an advisory entity is carrying out projects in communities. The Committee has made a commitment to assist the Department but the Department must furnish the members with the plans and all necessary information so that provinces could be called to account for the grants collected. It would also assist the Committee with its oversight functions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Filtane reminded the DG that he had suggested the previous year that the Department must ensure that they instruct their entities to align themselves with the mandate of the Department.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe DG responded that now that the Department was well aware of what the Committee expected, it would work on the issues raised and make sure that its entities are aligned to the Department&rsquo;s mandate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson thanked the DG and the team for the informative session. She excused DAFF from the meeting.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Adoption of Minutes</strong><br />\r\nMinutes of Committee meeting held on 17 February were considered and adopted.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe Chairperson thanked all in attendance. The meeting was adjourned.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "summary": "<p>The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) confirmed that its response was based on the theme of the State of the Nation Address (SONA) which was &ldquo;Growing the Economy&rdquo; as captured in the President&rsquo;s statement that &ldquo;The year 2015 is the Year of the Freedom Charter and Unity in Action to Advance Economic Freedom&rdquo;. The current contribution of agriculture to economic growth and job creation was far below the potential of the sector. It was therefore no surprise that the President identified Agriculture as &ldquo;a catalyst for growth and food security&rdquo; and announced the revitalising of agriculture and the agro-processing value chain as one of the nine-point plan to ignite growth and create jobs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Department&rsquo;s focus was on job creation in the sector, the Agricultural Policy Action Plan (APAP), the inclusion of smallholder farmers in the Agricultural Economy, contribution of Agriculture to the GDP and the budget cut of the Department.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAgriculture delivers more jobs per Rand invested than any other productive sector and also remained critical in the face of rural poverty and food insecurity. The National Development Plan (NDP) estimated that Agriculture could potentially create 1 million jobs by 2030. However, conditions for meeting this target included a focus on high growth commodities combined with improved delivery on land reforms and improved livelihoods within communal areas. The latest STATSSA Quarterly Labour Force Survey confirmed that Agriculture contributed the greatest number of employees at 56 000 quarter on quarter and sustained increases in job creation year on year of 28 000. This number would grow as it institutionalises the Agricultural Policy Action Plan (APAP) and significantly increases the production of strategic commodities by smallholder producers. The Department also has a number of initiatives to bring new entrants into the sector. The Department&rsquo;s bursary scheme which was introduced in 2003 produced over 1 000 graduates. The bursary scheme also targets Grade 11 and 12 learners at rural schools and in the Western Cape.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs stated in the SONA, government was working with the private sector to develop an APAP, which would bring one million hectares of under-utilised land into full production over the next three years. The APAP had been recommended to Cabinet for approval by the Economic Sector, Employment and Infrastructure Development Cabinet Committee two days prior to the Committee meeting. The APAP is a set of detailed actions with timeframes that would revitalise the Agriculture and Agro-processing value-chain, sought to translate the high-level responses offered in the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Strategic Framework, into tangible, concrete steps and actions. The Department was positive that the APAP could by 2019 potentially: increase the number of smallholder producers from 164 000 in 2012 to 400&nbsp;500, increase value added of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (AFF) from R42.5 billion in 2012 to R48.9 billion in 2019 &ndash; a 2% real growth per year, real increase in value of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries net exports from an annual average of R5,1 billion in 2012 to R5,8 billion in 2019 &ndash; a 2% real growth per year, decrease in value of diesel, fertiliser and machinery imports at an annual average of R9,6 billion in 2012 to R7,4 billion - a 3% real decline per year, reduction in the share of households experiencing hunger from 10,8% of households in 2012 to 8,0% of households in 2019 and an increase in number of jobs in Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries from 660 000 average for 2012 to 822 500 which is an additional 162 500 jobs and a potential 1 million jobs by 2030.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe tracking of the performance of smallholder producers would be improved over the next two years. At present smallholders were statistically unknown and there was no uniformity in the definitions and categorisation of different categories of farmers. The DAFF proposes to complete this project by mid 2015/16. The Department through the Province would invest R100m over the MTEF period to leverage growth of the private sector in this Cluster. In the 2015/16 financial year, it would directly invest R20m for bulk-water supply and in-field irrigation. Such initiatives going forward would become a reality in the 27 priority district municipalities. Lives would be changed for the better as market access for smallholder farmers, leverage private-sector investment in Agro-processing and provide technical support to smallholder farmers would be created.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter 5 years of technical work on resolving the phyto-sanitary requirements, agricultural trade protocols for the export of South African Maize and Apples to China were concluded. Export of apples alone has been projected to generate R500 million in foreign exchange and thus the industry is gearing up to plant an additional 10,000 hectares thereby creating 13,000 new jobs over the next 3-5 years because it takes at least 3 years before new apple trees begin to bear fruit. The APAP included the deployment of a range of policy and financial resources to bring 1 million hectares of under-utilised land into full production over the next 5 years.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe severe budget cut of over R230 million in 2015/16 and similar cuts in subsequent years meted out to the Department were emphasised. In the context of the 2015 Estimates of National Expenditure, there is a worrying trend that whilst the majority of departments enjoyed significant increases or budget cuts below 100%, DAFF received a cut of minus 309.4%. If the DAFF did not have the budget to implement the inspirational and widely supported programmes, the above listed impact would not be realised.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMembers unanimously expressed their concerns regarding the Department&rsquo;s budget cut as the cut would place a limit as to how best the Department would be able to implement its laudable plans. Most of the members emphasised though that the Department&rsquo;s inability to effectively channel previous budgets in the right direction might have been the cause for the cut. Treasury must be summoned to shed more light on these insinuations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA member asked whether the Department could indicate the farmers that would be beneficiaries of the programme so that the effectiveness and the target area may be assessed. He had not come across any structure that had signified that they benefited from the scheme. Another member pointed out that there was a need for the Committee to get a presentation from the Portfolio Committee on Rural Development and Land Reforms on the implications of the proposed plans for land reforms as people were getting extremely negative of innovative ideas that were constantly being brought up but the farmers not given the space to grow their industry despite the large amounts of land available in the market. It was also crucial for the Minister to be summoned to the Committee to give responses to some policy issues. What disaster plan had the Department put on ground to curb the impact of the drought?&nbsp; How long would it take for implementation of the Department&rsquo;s plans in provinces as it had been observed in the past that so many resources had been spent on projects with no obvious results though few successes had been seen. It was proposed that the Department liaise with commercial farmers on a 50/50 basis to implement land reforms in the fallow areas as many of the projects that had succeeded were as a result of a private/public partnership.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother member wanted to know what the Department was doing about the vast amounts of land lying fallow and unutilised for example in the Eastern Cape? How is the Department ensuring that young people especially from rural communities were prioritised and given bursaries so that they could use the land? How could young people afford themselves of DAFF&rsquo;s bursaries and internships? Why should the Department of Rural Development and Land Reforms front the programmes that should be fronted by DAFF? Did DAFF have programmes in place that could assist it in partnering with agricultural schools especially to aid the students to find work afterwards?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA member voiced his frustration regarding employment creation and proposed that DAFF could start a programme that would absorb young people into the Department for 3 years, after which the students would be released to start their own agricultural enterprise. With respect to the high costs of animal feed prices, he wanted to know why South Africa could not produce its own feed. It had been observed based on previous Committee Deputy Director General, Food Security and Agrarian Reform given could not be relied upon. The action was also a criminal offence. The Director General was advised to deal decisively with such matters. The concept of water harvesting was proposed to minimise the effect of the drought. The Committee needed to oversight the agricultural school in Middelburg in Grootfontein. Another member asked if operation PHAKISA was still on track?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother source of concern was the rollout of the small-scale fisheries plan. The fishing communities along the coasts had been experiencing huge problems with trust, transparency, corruption and such. The first implementation date for the rollout of the small scale fisheries plan was June 2014 but further information received has shown that the roll out would only be expected to kick off next year as there was still much to be done. Did DAFF have the money for the rollout of these programmes? Would DAFF be able to meet the deadlines that had been set as it could not afford to waste resources at this point.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson said the rates of the Land Bank should be reconsidered, and asked what steps had been taken on the disappearing money as those monies were loans that were to be awarded to other people. She commended the Department for the identification of commodities. It was a right approach.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Director General responding explained that since August 2014, DAFF, the National Treasury, the Department of Rural Development and Land Reforms and the Land Bank had been involved in several meetings and workshops. One of the aims of these engagements was to make sure that relevant departments work together and effectively apply their budget, and also to ensure that every Department used their budget for their mandates so that duplication of efforts could be minimised. DAFF and the Department of Rural Development and Land Reforms had been working together and had come up with an Integrated Funding Model to eliminate duplications from within both departments. Members had to have a better understanding of the mandate of each entity, as it would assist the members to have reasonable expectations from the entities. The Department is well aware of the drought and its effect especially in the provinces where it has impacted on the crops. South Africa would not be able to export maize and would have to import a small percentage; however, the NIMC would advise the Minister on the current import prices vis-&agrave;-vis the local prices.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Deputy Director General, Food Security and Agrarian Reform, emphasised that the issue of internships and the bursary scheme revolved around the budget. Each governmental department is supposed to recruit a number of interns annually equal to 5% of its staff compliment. DAFF with its staff capacity of a little over 7000 employed staff members must employ a little over 300, however the budget constraints would not allow for this. The Department has a popular accredited and transparent system of recruiting agricultural graduates. There were only 12 colleges of agriculture with one in Groenfontein. The college is being treated as one of the directorates in the Department due to the previous contestations between the Eastern and the Northern Cape. The Zolo College had also been reopened this year. The college for the first time would be recruiting students that would be trained as Para-veterinarians. A database of smallholder farmers exists however more work needed to be done on expanding the database so that it could cover majority of the smallholder farmers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProf Vries reported on the progress of the alignment of services between the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and its Entities and Provinces. The Government delivers services to citizens through two main machineries of state - directly through government departments (at national, provincial or local spheres) and through public entities (including associated institutions and state owned entities). There are currently five Public Entities reporting to the Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, namely the Agricultural Research Council (ARC), Perishable Products Export Control Board (PPECB), National Agricultural Marketing Council (NAMC), Onderstepoort Biological Products (OBP) and NCERA farms.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother area of attention was the strengthening and alignment of DAFF&rsquo;s public entities, the Agricultural Research Council (ARC): and the National Agricultural Marketing Council (NAMC) in particular, which has been actively involved in the development of APAP over the past 18-months. The research and data bases from the ARC&rsquo;s Soil Testing Laboratories were used in the spatial analysis and maps which were developed to determine which commodities could be produced in which places. Currently DAFF is enhancing these maps with data from other government departments on water sources and economic development zones.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe current duplication of effort between the ARC and the Research Directorate in the DAFF and between the NAMC and the Marketing Directorate in the DAFF were highlighted by the DG. The NAMC was established in terms of the Marketing of Agriculture Products Act, No 47 of 1996, as an advisory body to provide strategic advice to the Minister on all agricultural marketing issues, to improve market efficiency and market access by all participants, to optimise export earnings, and to improve the viability of the agricultural sector. As part of executing its mandate derived from the Act, the NAMC has in certain circumstances duplicated the work carried out by the Department in broad areas such as trade, marketing support, livestock development programmes, etc. The Department noted the duplication and has initiated a process of collaboration to eliminate the overlaps and streamline the functions between the Department and the NAMC on matters relating to agricultural marketing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMonitoring &amp; Evaluation of conditional grant projects is often inadequate and one of the PDAs biggest areas of double reporting is requests from the DAFF and Department of Rural Development and Land.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe lack of a national framework has created unnecessary confusion with regard to the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders, the nature of services they are meant to provide, the gaps that exist and a guide for appropriate packages of support per category of producer. DAFF is therefore in the process of developing a framework -norms and standards for producer support which would be primarily focused on financial and technical non-financial support to address the gaps that exists where support is provided by a myriad of stakeholders, including government departments, without a national framework.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo promote synergy between the DAFF, Public Entities and Provinces, DAFF recently developed an integrated planning framework, which defined the collaboration of activities between DAFF, Provinces and Public Entities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe DDG, Economic Development, Trade, Development of DAFF informed the members that on the 1 January 2015, an Executive Director had been appointed to drive the Forestry Sector Charter Council. The information was well taken by the members.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA member proposed that by the next meeting, the Department must come with actuals in their annexure to assist Members in engaging with the Department. The Chairperson supported this. All outstanding issues including the Extensions and Advisory Services, Fisheries and the NAMC presentations would be presented on the 6 and 10 March. She insisted the programme be forwarded to the Minister, as it was important for him to be present.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe acting Deputy Director General of Forestry and Natural Resources Management presented the Integrated Spatial Analysis on land capability and land use for Agriculture and Forestry to the Committee. He touched on food security and the production challenge, land capability assessment, classification and evaluation and the preservation and development of Agricultural Land.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe South African food production challenge and a steep decline in the area of High Value Agricultural Land available for crop production in South Africa had persisted. The current DAFF estimate was less than 0.25 ha per person per annum. He presented a chart that indicated the South Africa&rsquo;s food production challenge vis-a-vis the granted prospecting and mining rights per province. The chart reflected that many of the High Value Agricultural Land &ndash; HVAL had been issued on mining rights.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe enumerated the advantages of the 2014 Land Capability Evaluation, and presented the 2014 Land Capability Evaluation System, the Agricultural Potential Zones Conceptual Diagram, the fully Integrated National Geo-referenced Database and all the facets of agricultural land use planning- crops, forestry, animal adaptability, agro-ecosystems management, environmental risk and impact assessments, land degradation risk assessment and framework for future monitoring- climate change. He also highlighted the Draft Framework Policy and Bill on the Preservation and Development of Agricultural Land, which included Spatial planning &ndash; Suitability modelling and Spatial zoning and associated regulations - Primary Food Production Zones.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMembers applauded the information. There were discussions regarding the piece of legislation that was passed last year by the Department of Rural Development and Land Reforms called SPULMA. However, it was evident that another bill that would speak specifically to the classification of land and the high value of agricultural land is essential as SPLUMA did not address the issues of agricultural land. Members expressed their concerns regarding the huge amount of land that the country had lost to mining and even more outrageous is the fact that these lands could no longer be used for agricultural purposes. Was the Department was consulted before mining rights were issued? It was also suggested that the information be shared with the Department of Mineral Resources.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe DDG responded that currently, the mandate of the subdivision on agricultural land does not make provision to comment on whether a land could be used for mining purposes or not. Some of these concerns had been shared with the Department of Mineral Resources and they had also shared their plans on how to regulate the encumbrance of land for mining to accommodate more agricultural land use. On afforestation, the Western Cape, Limpopo and Mpumalanga have been identified and about a 100 000 hectares of land had been identified in the Eastern Cape and KZN but this was also subject to water licensing. In provinces, DAFF has officials called Resource Auditors and they were responsible for the conservation of Agricultural Resources Act. They organised awareness programmes and the Department encourages them to include subdivision issues or change of land issues during these awareness programmes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA Member passionately emphasised that the time had come where the Department must bring to the attention of Cabinet the serious consequences going forward of what was happening. As a nation, millions could not be battling to have food on their table and a situation where mining activities would reduce the amount of productive land that could be used for agricultural purposes be accepted. There is a need to use these lands to produce the number one basic need of the people, which is food. Mining is a secondary need. This Committee must also conceptualise a legislation that would give the Department exceptional rights that would make the agricultural need of a land supersede that of mining. All the Members supported this statement.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore concerns were raised regarding the realignment between the different entities. As much as the members understood the mandates of each entity, it had been observed that some of the entities carried out projects that were different from their mandates</p>\r\n",

The meeting had been convened in order to understand the challenges faced by these entities and how the Portfolio Committee could assist in mitigating them. The Committee had had interaction with some associations in December, including with the Horse Racing Association on the challenges of availability of vaccines. The previous Committee had had an interaction with the National Wool Growers Association (NWGA) and intervention had taken place, hence this meeting was important to measure how much had been achieved since the agreement reached with the previous Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apologies were read from the Deputy Minister, who was out of the country, and the Onderspoort Biological Products (OBP) CEO, who was also out of the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members of the Portfolio Committee were introduced by the Chairperson. The Director General of DAFF introduced the delegates from the Department, and the Chairman of the National Wool Growers Association of South Africa also introduced his team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr T Ramokhoase (ANC) informed the house that Ms T Gasebongwe-Tongwane (ANC) was indisposed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson said that her apology would be noted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Briefing by National Wool Growers&rsquo; Association (NWGA) of South Africa</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Harry Prinsloo: Chairman, NWGA, gave a brief introduction on the importance of this meeting. Wool was the biggest commodity in South Africa, as it had a turnover of about R50 billion at the consumer level and a 60:40 ratio between formal and informal production in South Africa, which showed the importance of the industry. South Africa could export wool to anywhere in the world. NWGA, being on the production side, had a responsibility to consumers for food safety, as Onderstepoort Biological Products (OBP) played a very important role in the quality of wool in South Africa, hence the need to comply with security measures that could affect consumers. The importance of the meeting could not be underestimated, hence the need for NWGA as manufacturers and the Portfolio Committee to reach an agreement as to how to resolve the issues involving OBP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Charlotte Nkuna: Vice Chairman, National Animal Health Forum, briefed the Committee on the issue of OBP, which had been started a few years back and had progressively not been resolved, as all parties had not reached a point where all parties were satisfied with the development. OBP was an important entity not only to DAFF, but to farmers as well, as it provided vaccines that were not produced by any other facility. Therefore, if its vaccine production was not going well it would have a wide-ranging effect. Issues to be ironed out included the production of vaccines such as Bluetongue and Brucellosis S16, as there had been a struggle to get the right quantity of these vaccines at the right time for a few years. There had been several engagements with the entity on how to get to a point where the parties were satisfied, but it seemed the issue was beyond OBP. Communication was also an issue in terms of updating the farmers on vaccine availability, and this needed to be addressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was need to understand how these problems could be resolved as it would be difficult to assist OBP if their problems and challenges were not understood. Moving forward, solutions should be looked into, as farmers needed vaccines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Leon de Beer, CEO: NWGA, briefed the Committee on wool sheep farming -- a lucrative commodity for rural development in the Eastern Cape. The Association represented South African wool producers and had a voluntary membership of 4 325 commercial producers, with 756 communal shearing sheds which represented about 15 000 individual small-holder and communal wool sheep farmers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Export destinations in 2013/14 included countries like China, the Czech Republic, Italy, India, Germany, Egypt and the U.K. Other countries include Mauritius, Portugal and Hong Kong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Key challenges of emerging producers were the quality and quantity of wool produced in communal areas; informal market/traders; infrastructure; harvesting and classing wool; market access; knowledge and information; stock and wool theft; predation and stray dogs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The social impacts of sheep farming on the sector were reflected in the fact that income from sales of wool and mutton made up 47% internal income in 2004, and this had increased to 59% in 2006 and 65% in 2009. Social indicators from 2004 to 2009 showed a reduction in the percentage of children going to bed hungry, from 43.1% to 27.3%. Households&rsquo; savings accounts had increased from 56.9% to 77.3%, and borrowed money for school fees had reduced from 78.4% to 52.3%. Job creation had resulted in a 30% increase in the number of communal producers in the formal market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In conclusion, he added that wool was a non-perishable market when this was opportune. The export product earned foreign currency for households in the most rural and extensive farming areas in South Africa. Wool was &lsquo;new&rsquo; money to stimulate and support the rural economy. Wool had been the stimulus for the establishment of many rural towns in South Africa over two centuries, plus a commercial bank. Wool had the potential to continue to support rural development even today. NWGA needed a partnership with the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform (DRDLR) to continue with the research and development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Discussion </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms A Steyn (DA) thanked the NWGA for their presentation, and added that it was important to meet with the industry role players in order to know the problems they had on a daily basis. Information was required on the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) and on production in provinces other than the Eastern Cape, since the NWGA was a national organization. She asked for an explanation of a graph shown in the presentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Prinsloo replied that the graph was basically meant to explain the impact of vaccine unavailability on production, and the effect of what happened when it was available. Currently in South Africa there were two seasons and if vaccines were not available for farmers to inoculate before going into the next season, it would affect their production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr De Beer said that the NWGA had a small footprint in KZN and was in negotiation with the KZN department to see if it could build extension offices, which needed to be supported by infrastructure projects. The NWGA also had a smaller footprint in the Free State, but due to a lack of funds or a lack of capacity, it had been low key. The NWGA could also roll out to the Northern Cape, but some training would be needed by the farmers. He was not sure of the status of the MoU since 2011 -- the NWGA had been working with DAFF on the possibility of renewing the MoU since then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Ramokhaose commented that most of the issues raised were operational matters which were not related to policies. He required an explanation on why the NWGA was short of expertise and why it struggled to get vaccines. Communication on vaccine availability should not really be a problem. He wondered why there was a serious gap in operations, when the policies were clear. He asked about when the Wool Trust had been established, the effect on training and how it should be handled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Prinsloo replied that the NWGA was one of the beneficiaries of the Wool Trust, as it got about R9 million per year from the trust. 65% of the budget went to small scale farmers and communal farmers of the Eastern Cape. The NWGA had a database of successful communal farmers that benefited from the NWGA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr De Beer said that informal trading was a free market system and the only way to convince communal farmers in the informal market was to train them and give them information that there was a formal market, where income could be placed vertically. The problem was that most of these small scale farmers had only four or five sheep, and about forty sheep would be needed to make a bale of wool, hence the need for communal farming sheds, where farmers would be organized around infrastructure so that they could collectively market their products on a business scale. This emphasised the need to train farmers to get access to the formal market. The wool brokers were the main role players in this industry as they assisted the farmers to sample the wool and test for quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Nkuna said that the vaccines were not on the market, and a response would be better explained by OBP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr C Maxegwana (ANC) commented on the need to hear from small scale farmers when the Committee went on oversight visits. Elaboration was required on the support that the NWGA was being offered by the DRDLR, DAFF and the provinces in terms of shearing, as well as on the role of the NWGA in marketing. He asked if there was a unit responsible for marketing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr De Beer said that the DRDLR had been a close partner to the NWGA in the past, but unfortunately the Association had not received much support from the previous administration. The Minister had come to the Association&rsquo;s rescue and had been supportive with infrastructure. DAFF could give the NWGA money for genetic improvement and infrastructure. NWGA needed money for training and mentorship, as it needed to extend its offices by training more extension officers in more provinces. NWGA had met with the Department of Home Affairs towards the end of last year on the problems with shearing. The focus would be on training shearers from South Africa, and Home Affairs had helped NWGA to classify sheep shearing as a critical skill which would assist the Association in getting visas for people from Lesotho. NWGA envisaged training 450 sheep shearers this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson asked for clarification on the developmental programmes offered by NWGA, and their challenges. In the last interaction NWGA had with the Portfolio Committee, it had referred to challenges with labour it sourced from Lesotho, and there had been an agreement with the previous Committee that South Africans would be trained. She asked if the 30% job creation mentioned in the presentation referred to South Africans, or to those from Lesotho.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr De Beer replied that the 30% job creation was for South Africans only.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn asked about the losses in 2010/11.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Prinsloo replied that in 2010/11, there had been a decline of about 4 million kg. About 46 million kg had been produced, of which 8% had come from the communal farmers. Eastern Cape and Lesotho wool was marketed through the South African market auction system, so a loss of about 4 million kg per year would be estimated at a rate of R50 to R60 per kg. However, the price of wool had been stable over the last three years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson thanked the delegates for their presentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Briefing by Horse Racing Association</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Larry Weinstein, CEO: Horse Racing Association, said the association had been established in 2005 with the assistance of the Western Cape government. It was a nongovernmental organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Bennie van der Merwe, Councillor: Thoroughbred Breeders Association, briefed the Committee on why the Association should be allowed to continue and the challenges it faced. African Horse Sickness (AHS) was a disease prevalent in South African horses, and this had reduced the chances of exporting horses to other countries from South Africa. The hosting of the Olympic Games would never be considered because of AHS. South Africa could not go for the Olympics in 2024, hence the need to address the Committee. The Association had held a workshop on the import and export of horses with some international veterinarians, where it had been suggested that if there was a lock-up facility in Cape Town it would prevent the spread of AHS and would enable the export of horses from South Africa. Vaccines were very important in the combat of horse diseases, as was the use of a diagnostic test tool to determine the presence of the diseases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Discussion </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn asked if there was a way to distinguish between vaccinated animals and infected animals. What was the main use of the diagnostic tool? She asked why exports were banned if the risk was said to be minimal. Animals that participated in sports events must be vaccinated with OBP vaccines, and she asked if there was a record of deaths of vaccinated animals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Van der Merwe replied that the diagnostic test was a DNA-based molecular test that gave a rapid result. The European Union (EU) had the resources to check whether countries could validate their claims that animals were vaccinated, so it was convenient for countries to hide behind the long protocol made by the EU. South Africa had come up with this diagnostic tool, which needed to be absorbed into the EU manual. It was the first diagnostic tool in the world that was good enough, as it gave consistent and very accurate test results which could be certified with absolute certainty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He added that the Association was still preempting the finding on why the risk of exporting AHS would be minimal. Traditionally the rest of the country had been experiencing an outbreak of AHS every year during late summer, when there was a high activity of the disease that transmitted AHS. The Western Cape had not been affected with AHS, as the disease usually started in other provinces and then migrated to other parts of the country. AHS was a notifiable disease and it was the duty of the veterinarians to report death cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Ramokhoase commented that the problems of the Association were mainly policy issues, and asked them to propose how to deal with the law in order to favor the Association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Van der Merwe replied that there was legislation in place that regulated the movement of horses into Western Cape Province because of the efforts to comply with the old EU and Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) legislation, to keep the disease out of Western Cape. However there were international challenges which the province could not overrule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Maxagwane commented that the Department had taken some steps to address the Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) redline in the country. He asked the association to clarify what it had done in terms of FMD/redline. He also asked for the problems in the Eastern Cape, as they were not in the capacity to compete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Van der Merwe replied that in the Western Cape there was traditionally a lack of the annual AHS due to the legislation that restricted the movement of horses into the province hence a lot had been done, but more could be done in controlling diseases. Government intervention was needed in the industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Edith Vries, Director General, DAFF, commented that the theme for this year was centred on growing the economy. Agriculture was a sector that would bring about economic growth and job creation in the shortest possible time. She applauded the presentation of the NWGA which highlighted the size of the industry and the impact of wool quality on the economy. However, some of the issues raised were operational matters and OBP would address the issue on vaccine production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DAFF had to raise more money from Treasury to address the infrastructure issues at OBP. Industrialization was a priority to the President, so the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) was interested in the expansion of OBP. She added that OBP had released 7 000 doses of Bluetongue vaccines and by the end of January, the entity released 1 million doses. She said suppliers placed orders to which OBP responded, as oversupply could not be made in excess of demand because vaccines would lose their shelf-life, which involved huge losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Bothle Modisane: Chief Director, Animal Production and Health: DAFF commented that the MoU was being worked on, as it had gone to Legal Services. He added that vaccine efficacy was not an issue, as vaccines would have been withdrawn by OBP if the efficacy was not good. There were three types of Bluetongue vaccines, and the problem with live vaccines was that the timing of the vaccines had not been prompt, as it was prudent to vaccinate much earlier -- before the risky season. The issue of vaccine availability would be addressed by OBP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said that during the outbreak of Yellow Fever disease, a lot of precautions had been taken and DAFF had always been involved in negotiations with the Organization for Animal World Health to try to broker an agreement with the Chinese Government on the importation of wool. DAFF met regularly with the NWGA and would address any issues of concern together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He commented that DAFF had had a meeting with the Deputy Minister on challenges involving the establishment of lock-up facilities, as there were different views from the Western Cape, KZN and the Eastern Cape. The Western Cape had never had cases of African Horse Sickness, which had been used as a negotiating point for purposes of export to all over the world, but the EU had concern about the outbreak happening in the free zone of the Western Cape. DAFF had negotiated for a better free facility from which South Africa could export horses to Mauritius, Dubai or other areas. The group negotiating for an establishment of a locked up facility in KZN was looking at it from the point of view of the Olympics taking place in KZN. Under normal circumstances, KZN was a high risk area and other countries may not be interested in importing their horses from KZN. From the Western Cape point of view, there was a better chance, as the weather had not been transmitting AHS, hence the need to come to one position of negotiation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Vries commented that the MoU with the NWGA had not been implemented. There was a need to sort out some issues, because the MoU was being funded by the DRDLR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DAFF on World Organisation on Animal Health (OIE) mission to South Africa </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Mpho Maja: Director: Animal Health, DAFF, briefed the Committee on the OIE mission to South Africa to evaluate controls for Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>2013 OIE Mission</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2013 OIE Mission, which covered four countries that had zones free of FMD, started on 28 October with a visit to Namibia and Botswana before coming to South Africa from 3 to 8 November. A one-day visit to Swaziland was slotted in during the South Africa visit, on 5 November. The aim of the mission was to assess the implementation and compliance with the relevant provisions of the <em>Terrestrial Code</em>, to ensure the maintenance of FMD free status and in the case of South Africa, to assess the situation following the suspension of its FMD free status with effect from 25 February 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following findings were made from the mission:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Identification of animals within the protection zone;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Visibility of the veterinary services control;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* The internal control measures already applied in the protection zone should continue to be managed;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Introduction of animals from the protection zone into the free zone;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Ndumo and Tembe must be managed similar to the Kruger National Park (KNP);</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* the protection zone in KNP, and maintenance of the international fences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following this mission, the Department submitted an addendum to the OIE, giving specific assurances. 600 000 unique ear tags were procured for the protection zones and the high surveillance zone of KZN; a software system to enable data capturing of individual tags as well as ownership was procured, though this process proved to be lengthy. The veterinary procedural notice was amended to comply fully with the OIE Code and its terminology. The fence in KZN, which used to be called the &lsquo;redline fence,&rsquo; was re-erected and the international fence continued to be maintained, though financial constraints made it difficult.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>2014 OIE Mission</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2014 OIE Mission was dedicated to South Africa as a follow up to the 2013 mission. This mission took place from 30 November to 6 December 2014. Its aim was to assess the compliance with the relevant provisions of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code (Terrestrial Code), and to ensure the maintenance of FMD free status -- including the measures described in the addendum to the application which was submitted for recovery of FMD free status in January 2014, regarding Limpopo, Mpumalanga and KZN provinces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Findings</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following findings were made from 2014 OIE mission:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Progress had been made with regard to the animal identification, though progress was found to be slow. The team advised that tagging had started from outwards inwards, thus ensuring that animals close to the free zone were identifiable should they stray into the free zone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Progress had been made with the building of the &lsquo;redline fence&rsquo;. They raised concern, however, that there were no manned check points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* A few breakage points were discovered by the RSA-Zimbabwe border fence and there was no documented procedure on how stray animals would be handled when found.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Separation of animals at dipping in KZN -- due to a shortage of facilities, animals from the protection zone and those from the high surveillance zone were dipped on the same day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Slaughter of animals from the protection zone was not being practised at the abattoir.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Availability of vaccines -- a number of dip tanks in Limpopo were unvaccinated due to the Mpumalanga outbreak last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* The eastern boundary fence of Ndumo had been brought down by the community, making the possibility of contact between buffalo and cattle likely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Despite visibility having been a finding in 2013, very little had been achieved with road signage to inform the general public of the boundaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Completion and manning of the redline fence must be adhered to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Identification of animals closest to the free zone should be given priority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Filling of vacant posts had improved only slightly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* The team advised that monitoring of vaccinated animals, to assess the effectiveness of the vaccine, should be introduced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Progress</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Maja said the 2014 OIE Mission had indicated the following areas of progress:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Approximately 30 kilometers of the RSA-Zimbabwe border fence had been repaired and a standard operating procedure for the handling of animals had been developed and signed off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* KZN had prioritized the construction of dipping facilities, which would resolve the problem of separation of animals at dipping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* So far, only two abattoirs in Limpopo were slaughtering animals from protection zone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Availability of vaccines: 300 000 doses of vaccines had been procured, half of which went to Limpopo. 13 657 animals had been vaccinated by the end of January and it was expected that the vaccination campaign would be completed by the end of February. A further 300 000 doses were in the process of being procured from Botswana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* The KZN Department of Agriculture and Rural Development had undertaken to construct the eastern boundary fence of Ndumo. Construction would commence during February and be completed in June 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Surveillance of buffalo in both reserves was another concern. Work in this area had already started with samples from Tembe being collected and sampling in Ndumo to commence in the second half of March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Visibility: all three provincial Departments of Transport had been approached and all had given permission for signage to be put up. Procurement of road signage was in progress, with Limpopo having placed orders and expecting delivery by the end of February 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Completion of the redline fence was expected at the end of May 2015, as 36% of the fence had been completed. 28 check points would be built into the fence, with 137 permanent posts already being funded, and 77 of which were filled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Identification of animals: prioritization of animals in the protection zone closest to the free zone had started.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Efforts were under way by DAFF to have vacant posts filled. 25 tradesman aid posts would be filled by the end of March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Post-vaccination monitoring programme: DAFF had established a surveillance plan for the entire protection zone and for the high surveillance zone of KZN.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* The Minister, Deputy Minister and Director General had led the &ldquo;Operation Compliance&rdquo; campaign in January, which consisted of Izimbizo and media campaigns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DAFF: Update on Compulsory Community Service regulations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Julian Jaftha: Chief Director: Plant Production and Health: DAFF updated the Committee on the Compulsory Community Service (CCS) regulations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of the Veterinary and Para-veterinary Amendment Act of 2012, the regulations for CCS were drafted and gazetted during 2013. Stakeholders were also consulted and workshops were held with students at the University of Pretoria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main challenge in finalising the CCS Regulations was that Section 20A(1) of the Act mandated that any person registering for the first time for veterinary and para-veterinary must perform CCS from commencement of the Act. The DAFF&rsquo;s intention was a phased-in approach, starting with veterinarians and proceeding to the para-veterinary professionals in later years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Section 20A (3) provided for the Minister to prescribe the circumstances under which persons may be exempted from CCS. The DAFF, the South Africa Veterinary Council and state law advisors who drafted the principal Act, met on 30 January 2015 to explore the implications of utilizing Section 20A(3) of the new Act as a method of averting the legal shortcomings, without amending the principal Act. Following the meeting, the state law advisors opted to re-look at both the proposed regulations and the implications of Section 20A(3) with regard to exemptions. There had been feedback on 20 February 2015 on the interpretation of Section 20A (3).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DAFF&rsquo;s legal services, together with the technical directorate concerned, were still reviewing the latest legal opinion regarding the exemptions of paravets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Briefing by Onderstepoort Biological Products </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Mpume Ramutle: Acting CEO of OBP, briefed the Committee on the importance of vaccines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vaccines were a preventive measure and were important to the success of primary healthcare. Veterinary vaccines were essential for protection of national herds, safe and efficient food production, control of emerging, re-emerging and exotic diseases of animals and people, reduction of transmission of most livestock diseases, control and prevention against most zoonotic diseases such as rabies, influenza, and brucellosis, and contributed to a reduction in usage of antibiotics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Raw materials/current processes in vaccine production include: disinfecting, autoclaving and discarding of waste material; cleaning of glassware, vessels and other small equipment/material; chemical dispensary; small medium production; bulk medium production (bacterial vaccines); viral medium production (viral vaccines) and ice packs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among key challenges in vaccine production was the recycling of glassware -- which was still being done manually. There was need to move to disposable/single- use options. Recycling of plastic ware such as roller bottles was not acceptable for good manufacturing practice (GMP). Capital investment for new equipment was needed to eliminate hand washing, as opposed to washing machines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Key challenges in the field of bacterial vaccine production were:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Infrastructure: plants needed to be upgraded, and new equipment was needed to increase yield.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Current equipment was becoming redundant -- new processes and technology needed to be cost effective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Outdated processes with low yields were not competitive, hence the need for a better process flow and skilled personnel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* The high cost of production disadvantaged farmers. There was no pilot plan for R&amp;D, hence the need for proper infrastructure that was GMP compliant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Viral vaccine production faced challenges with its open production process, monolayer; lack of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC); older technology (roller bottles, bottles of medium-new biobags and bioreactors (suspension cells)); sharing of the formulation room; no pilot plant facility and equipment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vaccine packaging challenges included redundant and old equipment; open lines; no HVAC; bottlenecks; predominantly hand-packing; unlinked, unconnected processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OBP was currently undergoing recapitalization with the objective of obtaining current Good Manufacturing Practice certification. Treasury had provided funding -- approximately R492 million -- for three years for this project, starting in 2012/13. The project consisted of three components: upgrade and modernization of the infrastructure and equipment, improving production processes, and training of staff. Phase 1 was upgrading the equipment of the old factory, and Phase 2 was the construction of a new facility. OBP had recently appointed the professional team to commence this work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Ramutle said OBP would become efficient and serve both local and international markets. There would be less disruption in production, with affordable products, especially for small holder farmers. Better technology was being introduced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, changing from old to new processes had its own inherent risks, and availability of the following products had been affected: African Horse Sickness, Bluetongue, B-Phemeral, Brucella S19 and Rift Valley Fever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A statement had been released in August 2014 indicating that some of the major issues had been resolved. OBP had promised that products mentioned would again be available from October 2014, and it had kept to this promise. Already, since late September 2014, key products such as AHS, Brucella S19 and B.Phemeral had been released to date. Nine out of the 12 products with which OBP had problems, had been delivered. Clamysure vaccine would be available in the first quarter of 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In conclusion, after all equipment had been installed by end of April 2015, yields would be increased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Discussion </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson commented that funds had been provided to OBP in 2013 to refurbish their office. This had been going at a slow pace, which was not helpful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Z Mandela (ANC) commented on the NWGA impact on wool exportation to other countries, and asked how they would ensure that the presentation was able to head out to the communities. The visibility of the NWGA was questionable, as it was located in Port Elizabeth, whereas the Eastern Cape was one of the biggest provinces in terms of meat production &ndash; it was known to have about six million sheep and seven million goats. Wool from these communities did not get to the markets, as most sheep were eaten by vultures, hence the need to capacitate people from grassroots to be able to produce wool and get it to the market, rather than focusing on exporting only. There was need to focus on refining the wool, as a lot of industries had collapsed due to international pressures. He asked what DAFF was doing in order to reach out to these communities and ensure their empowerment. He raised concern about the visibility of NWGA, located in PE, as a lot of lands were communally owned. He asked about the relationship of NWGA with the council/traditional leaders in terms of establishing centres of engagement, so as to be able to reach the communal people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Prinsloo replied that much of South Africa&rsquo;s wool goes to Europe, as South Africa was not competitive enough worldwide for clothing production, hence the reason for wool export. Two big plants that produced gowns in the Eastern Cape had closed down because South Africa could not compete globally in clothing production. He said NWGA would like to invite the Committee to see the wool industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr De Beer said that there was a huge role that NWGA could play in terms of training and mentorship. There were about 750 000 hectares of land that were not planted, and planting those hectares would double the stocking rate in the Eastern Cape. With funds from the Department, a meeting would be set up with the communities on where infrastructure would be located, as the NWGA did not have the capacity to reach out to everybody. There were many producers of wool among the communal farmers who could access the commercial markets. NWGA was trying to establish cooperatives, as it had identified the top communities producing wool and had trained their production advisers on the principles of cooperatives. These communities would have to participate voluntarily in these programmes, as the production advisers would remain for a period of three to four years as mentors to ensure that they managed the cooperatives securely. If successful with this programme, then NWGA would roll out to more communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Ramakhaose commented that the issue of service delivery to the people should be looked into, as the government had promised to deal with the issue of poverty and job creation. The President had made a pronouncement on the need for radical economic transformation, which the Department must understand in order to deliver to the people. He added that OBP should come up with solutions to overcome the vaccine unavailability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Modisane replied that normally the laws of the country were meant to be enabling, but they became a problem when there were requirements to export commodities, hence the need to take into consideration the laws of the importing country. Those were the ones that normally determined what needed to be done, hence the idea of protocols to enable the exportation of such commodities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn expressed her displeasure at the DG&rsquo;s comment that all things had been done to address the problems of vaccine availability, as OBP had not kept to their promises. The efficacy of the vaccines could not be known unless there was an outbreak. There was need to know the number of horses that had died from AHS after they were vaccinated. She required clarity on the negotiations that the Department had with China. She asked why it was taking the DAFF a long time to sign an MoU and wondered why the DRDLR was involved. She congratulated the Department on the OIE progress and required a full report from the Department on all its inputs. She asked if Botswana had supplied the full batch of FMD vaccine, or if OBP had produced part of the vaccines. How far had OBP had gone with the process of ORF/OVI/FMD vaccines, as the OBP was not known for development of vaccines. She expressed her displeasure about the CCS regulation report passed to the Committee in the last five years. She asked why there was massive shortage of practitioners on ground. She was concerned about the number of AHS cases reported to the OIE -- that only one animal had died -- and asked who was responsible for reporting to OIE on diseases, as declaration was expected to be done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Prinsloo replied that the NWGA had met with the Deputy Minister in August on the MoU issue and also had a meeting with the DG on 20 January, and was sure progress would be made. He added that vaccines were not arriving on time, as farmers needed to inoculate in October, January and February.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Maja acknowledged that there was under-reporting of incidences to the OIE, as indicated by Ms Steyn, and explained that OIE did not report individual cases of diseases, but events of diseases. OIE had a process of reporting diseases to DAFF, and DAFF would not want to report to OIE as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Modisane replied that negotiation was necessary to convince an importing country that the commodities to be imported were safe. The actual barrier to horse exporting was AHS, and other countries would come up with laws to prevent AHS. Likewise other countries imported wool from South Africa, and there was a need to convince them that wool from South Africa was safe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FMD vaccine had been sourced from Botswana, as there had been a need for OBP to revamp its production process when its vaccines were getting contaminated, in order to address the problem. FMD was a transmissible disease and the biosecurity was very high, so OBP could not combine the production of FMD vaccines with other vaccines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said that normally vaccinated animals were meant to develop immunity against the disease, but that was not always the case as many factors could affect the efficacy of such vaccines. Vaccines only reduced the risk of contracting the disease and under very high exposure they could still contact the disease. Environmental-host factors could be responsible for the deaths of vaccinated animals. For instance, poor handling of the vaccines could affect their protective function.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr P Mabe (ANC) commented that the Department should endeavor to write acronyms in full in their presentations to the Committee. There was a need to address the social challenges of the people in terms of job creation and departments should be able to report the number of jobs created. All the government departments and entities had to report the number of job created to the ruling party, which should constitute part of the Committee&rsquo;s oversight visit. The graph of sustainable jobs should be progressive, not regressive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Z Jongloed (DA) commented that she had also asked for a list of all the acronyms from the Department last year. She required clarity on transformation in the wool sector on genetic improvement, training and mentorship. What were the factors that made it impossible for communities to tap into the opportunities in communal forests?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Zama Xalisa: Senior Manager: National Agricultural Marketing Council (NAMC) said that some of the programmes in the wool industry had not been useful in transforming the sector as a whole. It was important for farmers to participate in the whole wool chain, rather than just train them to be breeders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson said it was important to understand how the Wool Trust was supposed to operate. She added that the Committee would invite all the Fund Trusts and the NAMC to present on the specific transformational outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Steyn said that she was not impressed with OBP&rsquo;s communication strategy on vaccine availability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson asked when the implementation of the compulsory veterinary services would begin. How far had the NWGA gone in ensuring that South Africans were trained in jobs, as agreed by the last Portfolio Committee? She commented that there should be a balance in the timing of vaccine availability in the market by OBP, and the timing for farmers to inoculate their animals. Government was focusing on job creation and building small and medium enterprises (SMEs), hence clarity was required on job creation. She congratulated the DAFF on its OIE progress update, and asked why OBP was not moving at the required speed. The Agricultural Research Council (ARC) had once told the Committee that it was doing research on FMD, and she wondered why ARC was not working with OBP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Prinsloo said that the NWGA had agreed with the last Committee to train South Africans on jobs, and the Department of Home Affairs had made shearing a critical skill, so the Association would train enough shearers in the shortest possible time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Nkuna replied that it was important to get enough information on vaccines for farmers to be able to plan, so that they would be able to survive those periods when vaccines were not available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Vries welcomed the idea that the state law advisers present to the Committee. She apologised for the acronyms used in the presentations, and promised that subsequent presentations would be noted. She said subsequent presentations would also include jobs created, and issues raised on the MoU would be addressed. DAFF would intervene on issues raised on vaccine efficacy and OBP communications on vaccine availability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chairperson thanked all the delegates present and said the Committee would continue to communicate, as agriculture had been identified as one of the key drivers of the economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The meeting was adjourned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "summary": "<p>The National Wool Growers Association (NWGA) said wool sheep farming was a lucrative opportunity for rural development in Eastern Cape. Wool was the biggest commodity in South Africa, as it had a turnover of about R50 billion at the consumer level and a 60:40 ratio between formal and informal production in South Africa, which showed the importance of the industry. South Africa could export wool to anywhere in the world. NWGA, being on the production side, had a responsibility to consumers for food safety. Onderstepoort Biological Products (OBP) played a very important role in the quality of wool in South Africa, hence the need to comply with security measures that could affect consumers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OBP was an important entity not only to DAFF, but to farmers as well, as it provided vaccines that were not produced by any other facility. Therefore, if its vaccine production was not going well it would have a wide-ranging effect. Issues to be ironed out included the production of vaccines such as Bluetongue and Brucellosis S16, as there had been a struggle to get the right quantity of these vaccines at the right time for a few years. There had been several engagements with the entity on how to get to a point where the parties were satisfied, but it seemed the issue was beyond OBP. Communication was also an issue in terms of updating the farmers on vaccine availability, and this needed to be addressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members felt there was a need for the NWGA to broaden its footprint outside the Eastern Province, and sought clarity on the status of its Memorandum of Understanding with the DAFF. They called for increased training for emerging small-scale wool farmers, and were told the Association planned to train 450 shearers in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Horse Racing Association briefed the Committee on why the Association should be allowed to continue and the challenges it faced. African Horse Sickness (AHS) was a disease prevalent in South African horses, and this had reduced the chances of exporting horses to other countries from South Africa. The hosting of the Olympic Games would never be considered because of AHS. Vaccines were very important in the combat of horse diseases, as was the use of a diagnostic test tool to determine the presence of the diseases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Association was asked why exports were banned if the risk was said to be minimal, and the Committee was told that the diagnostic test was a DNA-based molecular test that gave a rapid result. The European Union (EU) had the resources to check whether countries could validate their claims that animals were vaccinated, so it was convenient for countries to hide behind the long protocol made by the EU. South Africa had come up with this diagnostic tool, which needed to be absorbed into the EU manual. It was the first diagnostic tool in the world that was good enough, as it gave consistent and very accurate test results which could be certified with absolute certainty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DAFF briefed the Committee on the Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) mission to South Africa in 2014 to evaluate controls for Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD). The aim of the mission had been to assess the implementation and compliance with the relevant provisions of the Terrestrial Code,<em> </em>to ensure the maintenance of FMD free status and in the case of South Africa, to assess the situation following the suspension of its FMD free status in 2011. Challenges which had been identified during the OIE&rsquo;s 2013 mission to South Africa had been followed up on, and many areas of progress were reported. The Committee expressed concern on the under reporting of disease events by the Department to OIE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Committee was also updated on the Compulsory Community Service (CCS) regulations, in terms of the Veterinary and Para-veterinary Amendment Act of 2012, which were drafted and gazetted during 2013. The main challenge in finalising the CCS regulations was that Section 20A(1) of the Act mandated that any person registering for the first time for veterinary and para-veterinary must perform CCS from commencement of the Act. The DAFF&rsquo;s intention was a phased-in approach, starting with veterinarians and proceeding to the para-veterinary professionals in later years. Section 20A (3) provided for the Minister to prescribe the circumstances under which persons may be exempted from CCS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DAFF, the South Africa Veterinary Council and state law advisers who had drafted the principal Act, met on 30 January 2015 to explore the implications of utilizing Section 20A(3) of the new Act as a method of averting the legal shortcomings, without amending the principal Act. Following the meeting, the state law advisors opted to re-look at both the proposed regulations and the implications of Section 20A(3) with regard to exemptions. There had been feedback on 20 February 2015 on the interpretation of Section 20A (3). The DAFF&rsquo;s legal services, together with the technical directorate concerned, were still reviewing the latest legal opinion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Onderstepoort Biological Products (OBP) briefed the Committee on the importance of vaccines, which were a preventive measure and were important to the success of primary healthcare. Veterinary vaccines were essential for protection of national herds, safe and efficient food production, control of emerging, re-emerging and exotic diseases of animals and people, reduction of transmission of most livestock diseases, control and prevention against most zoonotic diseases such as rabies, influenza, and brucellosis, and contributed to a reduction in usage of antibiotics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Committee was told about key challenges facing OBP in vaccine production:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Infrastructure: full plants needed to be upgraded, and new equipment was needed to increase yield.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Current equipment was becoming redundant -- new processes and technology needed to be cost effective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Outdated processes with low yields were not competitive, hence the need for a better process flow and skilled personnel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* The high cost of production disadvantaged farmers. There was no pilot plant for R&amp;D, hence the need for proper infrastructure that was Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) compliant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OBP was currently undergoing recapitalization. Treasury had provided funding -- approximately R492 million -- for three years for this project, starting in 2012/13. The project consisted of three components: upgrade and modernization of the infrastructure and equipment, improving production processes, and training of staff. OBP would become efficient and serve both local and international markets. There would be less disruption in production, with affordable products, especially for small holder farmers. Better technology was being introduced. However, changing from old to new processes had its own inherent risks, and availability of products had been affected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Member disputed claims that all things had been done to address the problems of vaccine availability, as OBP had not kept to their promises. OBP responded that Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) vaccine had been sourced from Botswana, as there had been a need for OBP to revamp its production process when its vaccines were getting contaminated, in order to address the problem. FMD was a transmissible disease and the biosecurity was very high, so OBP could not combine the production of FMD vaccines with other vaccines.</p>\r\n",

The Office of the Auditor-General had also sent an apology.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs A Steyn (DA) suggested that the Chairperson write a letter to the Department to find out why it was always avoiding appearing before the Committee, and that it must let Parliament know exactly when it would make an appearance before it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Z Mandela (ANC) said the Department was not an individual, but a collective.

She indicated the recommendations should carry timeframes and that the Department should furnish the Committee with documents. The Chairperson supported Ms Steyn, saying the letter to be sent to the Department would also request the Department to forward the Committee documents.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>KwaZulu-Natal Oversight Report</strong><br />\r\nMs Steyn suggested an amendment to the last bullet on page 13 because there were unresolved issues for the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform in the area the Committee had visited, as some projects it had started were agricultural in nature.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Mandela suggested a joint portfolio committee meeting between the Committee and the Portfolio Committee on Rural Development and Land Reform so as to thrash out outstanding issues.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson took the Members through the report, page by page.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn moved the adoption of the report.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr S Mncwabe (NFP) seconded Ms Steyn.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe report was adopted without any changes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Western Cape Report on the Fisheries Section of DAFF</strong><br />\r\nWith regard to the recommendations in the report, Ms Steyn suggested that a few points be added. The recommendations should indicate a programme of action by the Department and should also spell out the research capacity of the Department, because it appeared to her as if the marine life in the areas visited was not protected.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson indicated that during the visit, the Department was reported as not having the capacity to monitor the movement of vessels after hours. The Committee had then suggested the Department should collaborate with law enforcement agencies and come up with plans. The Committee still had to hear a presentation from the Fisheries Section of the Department regarding this issue.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn insisted that the Committee recommend that the Department should report to the Committee on its research capacity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson tabled the report and took Members through it page by page.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn proposed acceptance of the report.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Jongbloed seconded the adoption of the report.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe report was adopted without any changes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn informed the Committee there was a massive drought in South Africa and this factor should be included in the annual programme of the Committee because there was a possibility that the country might be importing grain, whose price had already gone up by 35%.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr B Joseph (EFF) suggested an oversight visit to the Witzenberg area regarding the shoddy BEE deals between workers and farmers, because it had come to his attention that farmers were running the farms as if there was no deal between them and workers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe last issue the Chairperson touched on was that of the Marine entity which had received its own funding, because it looked like it was another department, although it was actually part of the Department. She indicated the Committee needed clarity on this matter, and also on how the Fisheries section was run.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Steyn told the Committee that the entity was a legislative arm and that it should be looked at thoroughly, because it was doing work on behalf of the Department. The Committee should look at its budget so that it could carry out its oversight visits well. It was pointless to diarise all these visits, only to discover there was no budget for them. It appeared to the outside world that money was being spent on catering, and if it was really spent on catering, she suggested the Committee should serve only tea, coffee and water.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Mandela proposed that the Committee should focus on the budget and be informed by it on what needed to be done. It should be remembered the Committee covered two visits per term, and this meant there were areas that would never see the Committee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr M Filtane (UDM) suggested the Committee be split into two teams in order to cover the visits, so that every corner could feel the presence of the Committee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chairperson noted that if the Committee became split into two, other parties -- especially minority ones -- might not be represented on the visits, because some Members alternate between committees. That could be done only when there was a need, but it should not be a policy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr C Maxegwana (ANC) said the Committee should focus its energies on the budget and look at how it could perform its duties with less budget. The Office of the Chairperson should prioritise what needed to be done.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe meeting was adjourned.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "body": "<p><strong>Apologies</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Chairperson said the meeting would last for only 45 minutes to allow Members to prepare for the sitting of the House at 10h00. She noted apologies from Mr L Ntshayisa (AIC), who was attending another committee meeting, Ms A Steyn (DA) and Mr B Joseph (EFF), who were preparing for the sitting of the House, and Mr M Filtane (UDM), who was making a media statement about the disciplinary report on the EFF by the Powers and Privileges Committee.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Briefing by Committee support officials</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Committee content advisor gave details of the oversight visit which would take place in northern KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) in two district municipalities from 24 to 28 November 2014, with Members flying to Richards Bay. The Committee would look at a number of projects which the Department supported in these municipalities. The Committee had initially wanted to visit two provinces &ndash; KZN and Limpopo -- but the House Chairperson had not approved the application because the Committee did not have enough funds to cover two provinces. KZN was the cheaper province in terms of travel and accommodation.</p>\r\n<p><em>Itinerary for Monday, 24 November </em></p>\r\n<p>Ms Albertina Kakaza, Committee Secretary, said the Committee would arrive in Richards Bay on Monday, 24 November, and would then drive over and sleep at Jozini Tiger Lodge. An introductory meeting would take place on this day, and would include the Committee from the province, district mayors and members of the national and provincial Department. If the mayors could not attend, representatives from the district municipalities would be present. This meeting would start at 17h00, because Members would be travelling in the morning. Dinner would take place at 20h00.</p>\r\n<p><em>Itinerary for Tuesday, 25 November </em></p>\r\n<p>Ms Kakaza said the Committee would go straight to the projects on this day. She had sent an invitation to the traditional leaders in the districts to welcome the Members.</p>\r\n<p><em>Itinerary for Wednesday, 26 November </em></p>\r\n<p>Members would meet with traditional leaders on this day. After this engagement, Members would see a commercial production and fishing communities, after which the Committee would drive and sleep over in St. Lucia.</p>\r\n<p><em>Itinerary for Thursday, 27 November </em></p>\r\n<p>Members would visit fishing communities and more traditional leaders. Members would then drive to Durban and sleep over. On the morning of Friday 28 November, Members would have a two-hour meeting to reflect on the trip and discuss the way forward. This would include the provincial committee and provincial and national Department. Members would then drive to the airport.</p>\r\n<p>Communication</p>\r\n<p>An official from Parliament&rsquo;s communications unit suggested a media statement be issued prior to the oversight visit. It could include the places to be visited and the purpose of the trip. On the first day of the trip, an alert could be issued so the media knew where the Committee was. This information would also go on to Parliament&rsquo;s social media portals (Facebook and Twitter) and Parliament;s website. A radio announcement could also be made. Regular statements would be given throughout the trip, and she would be writing articles regularly for Parliament&rsquo;s website and the internal magazine &ldquo;In Session&rdquo;. During the stay, she would liaise with the media to see if anyone wanted to interview the Chairperson, as spokesperson for the Committee. At the end of the visit, a wrap-up media statement would be made to explain what the Committee had found, and what it was happy and unhappy with.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Committee Researcher&rsquo;s Briefing</strong></p>\r\n<p>A Committee researcher said the district municipalities were chosen because most of the areas were in traditional areas (communal land). There were also huge investments in these districts, but there were also water access issues for the small-holder farmers. The Committee could assess what sort of intervention the Department was providing to aid these people. The Committee needed to note the red line fence for foot and mouth disease &ndash; the red line fence was supposed to demarcate the separation zone between animals from SA and those from Mozambique. There were questions about the integrity of this fence, but the Committee could make its own observations about this.</p>\r\n<p>Forestry projects, largely commercial, were chosen in Richards Bay but because the Committee had not dealt much with forestry projects, the Department would come back on this. It would be a good idea for the Committee to get an idea of how some of these forestry projects were working out on the ground &ndash; this was why these projects had been chosen. They were also in close proximity to Richards Bay, which remained the hub for the processing of forestry materials and products emanating from the projects. Like with agricultural projects, small-scale growers struggled to make an income and faced barriers in accessing the market in Richards Bay. Without pre-empting, these were some of the problems the small scale growers faced.</p>\r\n<p>Another Committee Researcher said the Department would focus on small scale fisheries in the Kosi Bay area. These areas were affected by removals, but had been applying traditional fishing methods. The management of fisheries in this area was under the competence of the Department nationally, but in KZN it was outsourced. Some of the problems experienced, like in Kosi Bay, were the demarcation of marine protected areas. Some of the areas which the communities used were not declared marine protected, and it was perceived by communities that fishing was restricted to tourists. In Kosi Bay, the fishing rights were handed out by the chief, where the chief had almost the same powers as the Minister in issuing rights and allocating fishing space. This was derived directly from the Constitution and not the Marine Living Resources Act. The chief demarcated the space, like land would be, for families to fish using mostly traps, and not rods or nets. A demarcated fishing area protected the family through generations with no conflict of resource use or sustainability. The issue, therefore, was around recreational anglers outside of the demarcated areas. This affected the livelihoods of these communities. There was also a lack of understanding between the parties concerning the legislation, so there were many issues to resolve, such as implementation and the implementing agent. Almost the same situation was seen in St. Lucia, but small-scale fishers were treated slightly differently, as they were issued with permits. These communities were looking forward to the small-scale fisheries policy, especially in relation to the implementing agencies.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Discussion </em></strong></p>\r\n<p>Ms Z Jongbloed (DA) suggested that language could be barrier and asked if translation services would be provided on the visit.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Kakaza indicated there would be two isiZulu translators with the Committee for the whole trip. It was also requested that the Department provide the Committee with a profile of all the projects. This was expected by the end of the week, or Monday at the latest.</p>\r\n<p>Mr M Mandela (ANC) was particularly fond of visiting the area of his great-great-great ancestors from the 1300s &ndash; he was very proud of this. In terms of the role of the traditional leaders, he asked if the lands and projects were run through the traditional councils for the betterment of the communities, and how the communities were benefiting from the targeted traditional councils. For some residing under traditional councils, this visit could be a good case study for comparison. Were these areas fully run by traditional councils, or were there parallel structures existing?</p>\r\n<p>The Committee Researcher responded that all of the land was under communal tenure. It was important to get a clear picture of the institutional arrangements. From the information provided by the Department, there were also allocated project leaders or coordinators, so it was not completely clear if the traditional leaders were part of this process or not. There were many observations for the Committee to make in this regard. With regard to the benefits to communities, there were many projects, but the yield to come out of production needed to be assessed. Even with mechanisation support and policies, it was not clear if the actual projects reported on had had that kind of assistance. It was one thing to receive a report on paper, but the exercise of Members actually going out to see would be useful and would verify a lot of issues on the ground.</p>\r\n<p>The Chairperson said it was important for the Committee to assess the traditional leadership arrangement. She had initially wanted the researchers to visit the area before, but such a request had never been made before and had to depend on the Committee&rsquo;s budget. The Committee needed to investigate itself to get the gist of what was happening on the ground and there should be interactive sessions with small-holder farmers to understand the challenges, to make a proper intervention. There were a number of issues which the Department had briefed the Committee on, which Members now needed to assess.</p>\r\n<p>Mr C Maxegwana (ANC) thought it would be helpful for the Committee to have a short paper on what sort of issues Members should keep an eye out for on the visit.</p>\r\n<p>Mr T Ramokhoase (ANC) was worried about the issues of mechanisation and the state of preparedness for the distribution of fertiliser and manure.</p>\r\n<p>The Chairperson thought the Committee should find out how much provinces were provided out of the equitable share for agriculture as a concurrent function. This was particularly pertinent, because agriculture had been prioritised as a job creator by government. She also questioned the readiness of the relevant policy.</p>\r\n<p>The Committee researcher replied the policy was ready but the implementation plan was not, so the old arrangement was still dominating.</p>\r\n<p>The meeting was adjourned as the bells for the House sitting began ringing.</p>\r\n",

        "body": "<p><strong>Opening remarks by Chairperson</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Chairperson welcomed officials from the Land Bank and AgriBEE to the meeting. She introduced the Committee members and read apologies from the Minister, Deputy Minister and Mr M Hlengwa (IFP).The meeting was convened after the legacy report was reviewed, with outstanding feedbacks from the Department on the implementation of the AgriBEE Charter and Forestry Charter.</p>\r\n<p>The Director General introduced her team and delegates from the Landbank.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Briefing by AgriBEE Charter Council</strong></p>\r\n<p>Mr Edwin Mohlahlo, Chairperson: AgriBEE Charter Council, briefed the Committee on the strategic plan and budget for the period from 2015/16 to 2017/18.</p>\r\n<p>The AgriBEE Charter Council had been established in terms of the Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BEE) Act No 53 of 2003, with equitable composition of stakeholders as members of the Council. The Council was inaugurated on 5 of December 2008, and consisted of major stakeholders in the agricultural sector. The Council was established as an advisory body to the Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. Its main purpose was to advise the Minister and the sector on all issues relating to transformation. The Council played a monitoring and evaluation role on the status of transformation in the sector. It also served as arbiter of issues relating to the implementation of the AgriBEE Sector code in the sector.</p>\r\n<p>The functions of the Charter Council included monitoring implementation of the AgriBEE sector code in the agricultural sector, as well as to review the code, provide guidance on sector-specific matters affecting B-BBEE in entities within the sector, compile reports on the status of B-BBEE within the sector, facilitate communication and popularisation of the AgriBEE sector code, develop an implementation framework for the AgriBEE, and alignment issues of the AgriBEE sector code.</p>\r\n<p>The vision of the Council was to be a principal advocacy agent in the transformation of the South African agricultural sector. Its mission would be achieved through the creation of an enabling environment for transformation in the agricultural sector, through the promotion of equitable access and participation of black South Africans in the entire agricultural value chain, the improvement of living and working conditions of farm and vulnerable workers, and the improvement of protection and standards of land rights and tenure security for labor tenants, farm workers and other vulnerable farm dwellers.</p>\r\n<p>The Council&rsquo;s strategic objectives were to monitor the implementation of the AgriBEE Charter in the agricultural sector as well as to review the charter, provide interpretation and guidance with respect to the AgriBEE Charter, share information with sector members and approved accredited agencies, facilitate communication and popularization of the AgriBEE Charter, and advise the Minister of DAFF with regards to the matters of the AgriBEE.</p>\r\n<p>The projected annual budget for 2015/16 was R 5&nbsp;154&nbsp;378, which was based on the Council being established as an independent entity. The projected budget for 2016/17 was R4 887&nbsp;686, and for 2017/18 it was R6&nbsp;670 223.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Briefing by Forestry Sector Charter Council</strong></p>\r\n<p>Mr Pasco Dyani, Chairperson: Forestry Sector Charter Council (FSCC) briefed the Committee on the Council&rsquo;s actions plans, including the financial implications of the implementation of the Forestry Transformation Charter.</p>\r\n<p>The forestry sector uses 1% of the total land (1 273 357ha) and employs about 146 000 in sawmilling, pulp and paper, timber boards and mining timber, and provides livelihood support to about 850&nbsp;000 people. It contributes 1% to the national GDP, and represents 7.7% of manufacturing GDP. Production is focused mainly on pulp and paper and sawmilling products. The sector derives 70% of its revenue from exports. The Forest Sector Charter originates from the B-BBEE Act, No 53 of 2003.&nbsp; It was launched in 2005, a steering committee was established, and it was published as a sector code in June 2009.</p>\r\n<p>The main objective is to extend economic opportunities and benefits of the forest sector to the previously disadvantaged black group.</p>\r\n<p>The FSCC was launched in May 2008 and operated as a section 21 company.</p>\r\n<p>Its main responsibilities include facilitating, overseeing, and encouraging the implementation of Charter; to monitor and report on the Charter undertakings; to monitor and report on the status report; to publicise the Charter; and to participate in government, industry and Council forums.</p>\r\n<p>The Charter reports to the President&rsquo;s B-BBEE Advisory Council, the Minister of Trade and Industry and Minster of DAFF. The Charter is composed of 20 board members and an independent chairperson.</p>\r\n<p>The FSCC&rsquo;s annual B-BBEE progress report on scorecard implementation for 2012/13 showed a sector level 5 status &ndash; a one level drop from the previous year, while qualifying small enterprises achieved level 3. The report indicated there was average performance in ownership, and poor performance in management control, employment equity and skills development.</p>\r\n<p>The objective for 2013/14 was to assess the status of transformation in the forestry sector. The assessment had been undertaken by a service provider; managed by a steering committee. The preliminary report had been discussed by the steering committee at the end of September, and the final report would be presented to Council by the end of November.</p>\r\n<p>The 2014/15 business plan budget of R8 506&nbsp;095 had been funded 60% by government and 40% by industry.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Discussion: FSCC</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>Mr L Ntshayisa (AIC) asked what support had been given on the issue of certificates to work at Sabie and Merensky by the Department or local government.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Dyani replied that DAFF was in a better position to answer questions on certificate issuance, as the Charter was not required to issue certificates. Some of the members in the Council board were executive directors at MTO Forestry, and would continue to encourage assistance to those communities close to them.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Z Mandela (ANC) asked what support was given to the local communities to run the Langeni Forest in Mthatha, to ensure that they were able to have it fully transferred to them. He asked who PG Bison was in partnership with in terms of the local community, and how the local community was benefiting. In KZN, the community had made several claims for Ingeli forest to be transferred to them. He asked what the Department was doing to ensure that the community benefited by having the land transferred to them. He asked why certificates were continuously awarded to entities, and not to local communities.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Elaine Alexander, DDG: DAFF commented that there had been challenges around collecting rentals, and one of the tasks of the Department was to ensure that those communities received the rentals. The Department was also ensuring that communities had access to working in the agro-forest industries with commercial partners, also in the indigenous forests. The Department provided support by involving the communities in sawmilling and other projects, and allowing access to the forest for firewood collection and beekeeping. There was an initiative to collect the firewood for biomass processing on a large scale. The Department allowed access to indigenous forests for spiritual purposes and mushroom collection. A previous initiative with SAFCOL involved looking at new types of mushroom production that could be done in the forest, and there had been collaborations with China on new mushroom initiatives around non-indigenous farms.</p>\r\n<p>Ms A Steyn (DA) expressed disappointment at the slow pace of land transformation at state-owned forestry lands, and asked for a progress report for the last few years. She asked about the board representing the forestry sector industry, and the independence of the chairperson.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Dyani replied that the board was composed of representatives of the timber industry and its own affiliates, which were the Pulp and Paper Association, SA Forestry Contractors Association, Forestry SA, and Cosatu. Government was represented by the Departments of Trade and Industry, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Rural Development and Land Reform, Water Affairs, the Industrial Development Corporation, and others. The Chairperson was independent, because the board&rsquo;s mandate was given by the Minister and did not belong to any stakeholders within the Council, but from time to time he would consult with the Minister on any issue.</p>\r\n<p>Mr C Maxegwana (ANC) commented that less focus had often been given to forestry by the Department and Portfolio Committee. He required elaboration on the problem of accessing land owned by entities by the people of the area. He added that 146 000 workers were employed in sawmills and the pulp and paper board producers, and asked what kind of job these workers had, as they were not permanent jobs and the government was concerned about non-permanent jobs. He asked for the reason for decline in the sector level 5 status from the previous year. He asked for the causal factors and improvement plans of the identified problems of poor performance in management control, employment equity and skills development.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Dyani replied that in 2012/13, the sector was on level 5 status, which meant it had performed badly as compared to the previous year, where it had level 4 status. The Council was striving to get the sector to level 1. Safcol reported to the Department of Public Enterprises, and was represented by Forestry SA in the Council, and there had been no progress from the previous year. Given the retrenchment taking place in the sector, it would be difficult to give the figure of those who were permanently employed, and those working on contract.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Khosi Mavimbela, from the Forestry Sector Charter Council, commented that poor performance and skill development were elements observed in the Council&rsquo;s score card as priority elements that would be addressed.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Z Jongbloed (DA) commented that there were 146 000 workers in employment. She asked what percentage of people had beenlaid off in the light of the Department&rsquo;s exit policy announced some years back and revised recently. The replanting of forests had not started in areas of the Western Cape and there were entire community of forest workers in the Western Cape where people were unemployed and living off state assistance. She asked if investigations had been done on the difficulties experienced by these workers and plans to assist them.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Dyani replied that the Council was not in touch with people, because its mandate was limited to monitoring and encouraging implementation of the Charter. He said it was high time it extended its mandate, as people did not know about the Charter Council. Funding was an issue affecting implementation, which had been picked up by the service provider working for the Charter.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Alexander sought the indulgence of the Committee to provide a full report on the number of people laid off, if allowed.</p>\r\n<p>Mr B Joseph (EFF) asked what had been done to implement the objectives of the Forestry Sector Charter Council. Clarity was required on the Sector 5 level, and its interpretation.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Dyani replied that there were levels 1 to 5.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Mavimbela commented that the levels went to level 8, which meant non-compliant. The sector was on level 5, which meant it was between compliant and non-compliant.</p>\r\n<p>The Chairperson agreed that responses should be sent in writing, and commented that the forestry section of the Department had not been performing for quite some time. She asked the DG for a report before the next meeting, as there would be discussion on the issue of land reform and how to ensure that the forestry sector worked. She appreciated the honest responses.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Mandela commented that his questions had not been satisfactorily answered, and hence would want written responses on the issues he had raised.</p>\r\n<p>The Chairperson agreed that a written report should be brought before the Committee.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Discussion: AgriBEE</strong></p>\r\n<p>Mr S Mncwabe (NFP) commented that AgriBEE was the principal advocacy agent in the transformation of the agricultural sector. He asked about the challenges identified in the transformation of the sector.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Mohlahlo replied that communication among stakeholders was a challenge; hence the Charter had taken on the role as an advocacy agency. There was no cohesion among the stakeholders, so there was a need to prioritise communication. Congresses of industry stakeholders had been attended for awareness on transformation. The Charter relied on media statements being issued, and depended on DAFF staff, as it had no budget for its own staff.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Steyn asked if the independent chairperson of the AgriBEE Charter Council was appointed by the Minister. She commented that the Committee had not received AgriBEE&rsquo;s annual report. She asked how the AgriBEE intended to carry out its role and mission of improving living conditions of farm and vulnerable workers, when the Department had a budget proposal only for salaries.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Mohlahlo replied that the AgriBEE sector code addressed issues of the tenure of farm dwellers and the security of farm workers</p>\r\n<p>Mr Joseph asked if the framework for AgriBEE had been developed and implemented. He asked what had been done in terms of advocacy pertaining to the transformation of the South African agricultural sector.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Mohlahlo replied that a reporting template for the AgriBEE sector codes for 2012 had been developed to ensure that stakeholders and government were held accountable for their commitments. The reporting templates would also assist in determining how far the industry and government went on transformation.</p>\r\n<p>The Chairperson asked about the activities, output and overall impact of the Council, considering the rising level of farm evictions and intimidation. She asked about the budget for 2014/15, as the projected budget provided was for 2015/16. She asked for clarity on the community consultation and communication strategy of both Councils, and how they both raised awareness.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Mavimbela commented that certificates were valid for one year, so it was waiting for its financial year to end before verifying some information and compiling the report.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Mohlahlo replied that the Council would ensure that the Committee was informed on what it was doing. He added that the Council did not implement but rather monitored, hence the introduction of an IT portal -- a web-based system for the industry stakeholders to upload their score cards, which indicated the level of the sector. The challenges could be reviewed by the performance of the media statement. 100% of the budget would be coming from the Department.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Kwena Komape, CD: DAFF, commented that the Charter was publicized as section 9.1 in Dec 2012, and its first report was due at the end of the financial year. In the 2014/15 financial year, the Council had been accommodated in one of the directorate&rsquo;s budgets, and that was why it had no figure. The IT portal uptake would dictate the number of inactive farms and the level of transformation within the sector.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Edith Vries, DG, DAFF, said that the report would be reviewed by the time the Department came before the Committee.</p>\r\n<p>The Chairperson commented that the sector had not done much, and should move with speed.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Briefing by Land Bank</strong></p>\r\n<p>Ms Lindiwe Mdlalose, Acting CEO: Land Bank, briefed the Committee on the role of the Land Bank regarding the administration of the Micro Agricultural Financial Institution of South Africa (MAFISA) loan finance scheme. The purpose of MAFISA was to provide loans to previously disadvantaged black farmers at a nominal interest rate. On-lending was done through intermediaries identified by DAFF. An agreement to manage the funds had been signed in 2006 to provide custody and management of the funds and make payments to intermediaries on the instruction of DAFF. In 2008, due to challenges experienced by the Bank in the administration of MAFISA, the new management revised the agreement. In November 2013, R136.3 million was repatriated to the National Revenue Fund on the instructions of the National Treasury, after a request by the DAFF to use the funds had not been approved. The current balance in the MAFISA account, as at 30 September 2014, was R2 593 270. A review was currently under way with National Treasury, DAFF and Land Bank to enhance efficiencies.</p>\r\n<p>The purpose of AgriBEE was to facilitate broad-based economic empowerment in the agricultural sector through the provision of grants to black South Africans. The initial purpose of the fund was to provide grants for the acquisition of equity in existing commercial agricultural enterprises by previously disadvantaged persons. The initial agreement that was concluded around 2006 was revised due to poor controls and in 2008 a new agreement had been signed.</p>\r\n<p>The role of DAFF includes the transfer of funds to the Land Bank; to receive applications from the provincial departments; to screen the applications and make recommendations; to forward them to the Land Bank for due diligence; final approval after due diligence by Land Bank; administer and manage the funds; perform due diligence on recommended applications from DAFF; and make recommendations to DAFF on applications.</p>\r\n<p>In November 2013, R228 577 377 had been repatriated to the National Revenue Fund on the instruction of National Treasury. The balance in the AgriBEE fund as at 30 September 2014 was R 37 298&nbsp;526.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Mohammed Sizwe, Head: Retail Emerging Markets (REM), Land Bank, said the REM division was created as a response to challenges of market failure regarding black emerging farmers, such as onerous collateral and security requirements. There was a high cost of funding based on risk, and high rates of default resulting from little or no support for the farmers. There was little or no integration of the agricultural value chain for emerging farmers, and a lack of dedicated focus towards this sector.</p>\r\n<p>The solution was the implementation of the REM model, which included the following unique value proposition: cash flow lending based approach; concessionary funding and interest rates; and non-financial support. Two approaches had been identified to market REM -- a wholesale finance facility and direct lending. REM processes included planning, engagement contracting, preparation set up, execution operations and re-investing for maintenance. As at 30 September 2014, REM&rsquo;s loan book exposure was R 391.2 million, with R723 million in the pipeline.</p>\r\n<p>REM had financed 365 farmers with 4 986 permanent employees, and1 498 farmers had attended training programmes.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Lefentse Radikeledi, Director, DFI National Treasury: commented that when National Treasury took over the Land Bank in 2008, it had no rosy history. A forensic audit had just been completed and it was discovered that a lot of reckless lending had taken place outside of its mandate. There had been a big write off of the book of the Land Bank, which had cost the government a lot of money. Treasury recommends and advises Parliament on how to spend money, using the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA) and Treasury regulations to manage those funds. All programmes that National Treasury recommended and advised the Parliament to pass, had well defined purposes. If any institution or department deviated from the purpose of its funding, it had to come from National Treasury and it was up to the Minister of Finance to approve the shift of funds from one programme to another. In terms of the Treasury regulations, the National Treasury had the power to recall unspent funds. He added that two letters had been written to Government departments, including DAFF and individual institutions. The first letter was written in July by National Treasury, but had been written basically as part of the process of rationalising surplus money that was sitting in the Department and government institutions. Those were funds lying idle, without having been spent for a period or more than a year.</p>\r\n<p>The second letter was written in October, directed to DAFF, requesting DAFF to request Land bank to pay back the money linked to MAFISA and AgriBEE. The reason was Land Bank had advised National Treasury that DAFF had requested that they use the money for a purpose that it was not initially meant for, and the money had been sitting in the account for too long. National Treasury had advised DAFF it should return the money to the National Revenue Fund. In terms of National Treasury regulations and the PFMA, it had a responsibility to protect the fiscus and recall unspent funds. National Treasury tries to avoid situations where a department does &ldquo;fiscal laundry,&rdquo; where the money would not be spent for a period and would then be transferred to another institution, because when the money was transferred to another institution there was the chance that the funds would be used for s reason not approved by government. This would be interpreted as financial mismanagement and the Minister of Finance or the department would be called to answer. AgriBEE&rsquo;s money had been recalled by National Treasury because the money had remained unspent in the books of the Land Bank for more than two years. Where funds are not used they are recalled, hence the recall of funds from Land Bank to the National Revenue Fund.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Baldwin Ngubane, Chairperson: Land Bank commented that Land bank had attempted to show the Portfolio Committee the areas of activities it was addressing to balance the disparities in the agricultural, forestry and fisheries sector of the country on land that was government-sanctioned and government supported. An institutional review of Land Bank was being undertaken and he hoped that the Committee would play a part in the organisational review, because there was need to look at a new funding model -- a new financing structure that would make the Land Bank sustainable financially. This would involve new instruments, particularly in the retail emerging market, the issues of RICA in terms of securities, track records, which were real issues for the farmers.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Discussion</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>The Chairperson said that issues would be discussed before the Minister, along with the Comprehensive Agricultural Support Programme (CASP) and the Micros Agricultural Financial Institutions of SA (MAFISA) evaluation done by the DPME, in order to close this chapter of the legacy report. She urged members to note the report and asked the DG to forward the report on the CASP and MAFISA evaluation. She suggested that another meeting be scheduled in order to invite the Minister.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Mandela commented that the information provided was not sufficient, and should be submitted fully before the Committee met with the Minister. He asked for details on the 365 financed farmers, the land leased and communal hectares that were farmed. Information was required on the reckless funding approved by Land Bank.</p>\r\n<p>Mr LC Radikeledi said that the funds were approved prior to 2010.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Steyn agreed that a discussion should be held with the Minister. More information was required on smallholder farmers, on the intermediaries-expired contract that was not renewed, and other issues. The document was flimsy, and full details were required on the financed farmers.</p>\r\n<p>The Chairperson thanked the CEO and his team for coming and requested them to add all the information as an annexure was not provided.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Consideration and adoption of the Committee Report on the Fishing Agreements and Conventions</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Chairperson commented that there were lots of gaps in the Committee report on the Fishing Agreements and Conventions, and the support officials had requested time for the Department to fill the gaps. She requested that the issue be postponed.</p>\r\n<p>It was unanimously agreed that it be postponed.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Consideration and adoption of Minutes</strong></p>\r\n<p>The minutes of the previous meeting were unanimously adopted, with amendment.</p>\r\n<p>The meeting was adjourned.</p>\r\n",

There is a Portfolio Committee for each national Ministry and its associated government department/s.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Select Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Council of Provinces (NCOP) appoints from its permanent members a number of Select Committees to shadow the work of the various national government departments and to deal with Bills.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause only 54 of the 90 NCOP Members are permanent delegates compared to the 400 of the NA, the Select Committees oversee the work of more than one national government department.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Public Accounts Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Assembly Standing Committee on Public Accounts acts as Parliament&#39;s watchdog over the way taxpayers&#39; money is spent by the Executive. Every year the Auditor-General tables reports on the accounts and financial management of the various government departments and State institutions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHeads of government departments and institutions are regularly called by this committee to report and account for expenditure. The Committee can recommend that the National Assembly takes corrective actions if necessary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Members&#39; Legislative Proposals and Petitions Committees</strong><br />\r\nDraft bills can be submitted by individual Members of the National Assembly. These bills are considered by the National Assembly&#39;s Standing Committee on Private Member&#39;s Legislative Proposals and Special Petitions. If the Committee agrees with the principle of the draft Bill, a Bill will be prepared and dealt with by Parliament.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe National Council of Provinces Select Committee on Members&#39; and Provincial Legislative Proposals considers draft Bills from individual NCOP members and provincial legislatures.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPetitions may also be tabled in Parliament and referred to the relevant committee that deals with the issue raised in the petition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Internal Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Assembly has a number of internal committees that deal with matters affecting the running of Parliament. The Committees normally consist of senior Members of Parliament. The Rules Committee and its sub-committees deal with House rules, the budget of the House, support for Members, internal arrangements, and powers and privileges of members. Other internal Committees are the Programme Committee that plans the work of the Assembly, the Disciplinary Committee, and the Committee of Chairpersons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe National Council of Provinces has its own domestic Committees. The Rules Committee and its subcommittees deal with the NCOP rules, the NCOP budget, parliamentary privileges, internal arrangements, international relations and delegated legislation. The Programme Committee plans the work of the NCOP and the Committee of Chairpersons make recommendations about the functioning of Committees and other NCOP forums.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Ad hoc Committees</strong><br />\r\nParliament or one of its Houses may appoint an ad hoc (temporary) Committee when a special task must be done. When the task is complete, the Committee is dissolved.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Joint Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces together appoint a number of joint committees, for example the Constitutional Review Committee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and the Joint Standing Committee on Defence are statutory Committees. This means that they are established, by the Constitution or by an Act of Parliament, as well as in terms of the rules of Parliament.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe committees play a very important role in the process of building democracy and involving the public in the processes and activities of Parliament.</p>\r\n",

        "body": "<p><strong>Livestock diseases in South Africa: Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Animal Fisheries (DAFF) briefing, in presence of Deputy Minister</strong><br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson welcomed the Deputy Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and Animal Fisheries, Mr Bheki Cele, and the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF or the Department) and reminded Members that at a previous stage, there had been bans imposed on South African exports of meat. DAFF would therefore now present and discuss the status report, and control and preventive measures for diseases, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) report, and give an update on compulsory community service for veterinarians, including regulations to that effect. She also asked that DAFF address the progress made in addressing the Constitutional Court judgment in relation to the Performing Animals Protection Act, 1935.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Mooketsa Ramasodi, Acting Deputy Director General, DAFF, noted that South Africa had invited the World Health Organization for Animal Health (OIE) to evaluate the performance of animal health in South Africa, following numerous complaints by the Red Meat Industry Forum (RMIF).The evaluation took place in October and was conducted by four experts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe experts&#39; findings in relation to physical, human and financial resources concluded that while financial resources were adequate and regularly provided, there was a lack of veterinarians in regular contact with farms and animals, resulting in reduced credibility. They commented on the sensitivity of passive surveillance and the need for early detection. They also pointed to a break in chain of command between national and provincial governments. They recommended that Veterinary Services must establishe clear strategy, policy and supportive measures to develop a more comprehensive network of veterinarians in the field who had regular contact with farms and animals. They proposed an optimal strategy to restore the national chain of command for all aspects of the Veterinary Service.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn respect of the technical authority and capability, OIE found that there was a good laboratory network but there was a lack of technical independence, particularly for abattoirs, the registration, audit and on-site inspection of facilities producing for the local market, and a lack of individual animal identification. OIE recommended that all provincial laboratories should receive adequate resources, that the Veterinary Services should appoint staff dedicated to risk analysis at central and provincial levels, and technical independence should be re-established for food safety.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCommenting on the interaction with interested parties, OIE found that communication with interested parties was well supported but did not address small holders and communal farmers with any specific material. Although official representation of the veterinary service in OIE and other international institutions was regular, OIE found that there was insufficient consultation with the relevant parties. It recommended that specific communication tools should be established to target all categories of interested parties, and that joint programmes should be developed for important diseases.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn relation to access to markets, the experts found that internal and external quality of legislation and regulation was satisfactory, although there were not enough dedicated legal staff to update regulations regularly. Furthermore, it commented that a lack of veterinarians in regular contact with farms and animals would limit the capacity of Veterinary Services (VS) to certify products or activities. They recommended that VS should recruit legal staff to adequately update its legislation, and that international certification and transparency should be improved by increasing the number of field veterinarians.</p>\r\n<p>The OIE experts noted that at the moment, the Veterinary Services of South Africa were still of a very high standard but cautioned that it found itself at a cross roads between a bright future and a rapid decline. The experts explained that a bright future required restoration of the chain of command with unity of different veterinary domains, and the development of a comprehensive VS system, including official delegation to private veterinarians. This would necessitate better interaction with all stakeholders and consumers, with priority given to addressing the public good. If this was not done, then a rapid decline would result from continued fragmentation of the VS by local authorities or by function, this would result, in turn, by activities becoming market driven by private interests, double standards in animal and veterinary public health, and there a failure to address the public good.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Ramasodi then outlined the progress made on the recommendations of the Provincial Veterinary Services (PVS) Report to include stakeholder consultations on 4&nbsp; and 5 June 2014, and the Gap Analysis from 17 to 26 June. He noted the preliminary discussions with provinces at MinTech, and preliminary draft actions that needed to be conducted,. He noted the receipt of the preliminary Gap Report analysis on 20 October, and noted also the preliminary draft on the animal disease management plan.</p>\r\n<p>Dr Mpho Maja, Director: Animal Health, DAFF, presented on the current status of animal diseases of economic importance. She highlighted that South Africa received OIE recognized Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD)-free status for the free zone in February 2014 and this was endorsed at the May 2014 OIE Annual General Meeting. South Africa had thus now regained its FMD-Free status, after having lost it following the 2011 outbreak of FMD in Kwazulu-Natal. Certain import restrictions from trading partners had been lifted.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe noted that the OIE set certain conditions for South Africa to maintain its free zone status, which included:<br />\r\n\t- Improved inspection of cattle in the protection z- one<br />\r\n\t- maintaining a fence between the free zone and protection zone in KwaZulu-Natal<br />\r\n\t- individual identification of cattle in the protection zone and signs on the roads between the free zone and protection zone.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThese measures were currently being implemented by the Directory of Animal Health and the provincial Veterinary Services, The OIE intended to carry out a follow up mission in December 2014.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDr Maja mentioned that there was an outbreak of FMD in the protection zone in Mpumalanga, with two more outbreaks reported in June 2014.She informed the Committee that an outbreak of highly pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) was reported in 2011, which resulted in the suspension of all exports of fresh products, but that was resolved in 2013 with the slaughter out of the last affected farm. However, South Africa had not been able to declare Freedom from HPAI, to regain its trade status, because of the ongoing outbreaks of H5N2.She reported that in 2014, three ostrich farms, in Hessequal Local Municipality and George Local Municipality had tested positive for low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPA) H5N2.By the end of June 2014, there were four ostrich farms reported as part of the ongoing LPAI H5N2 outbreak. The LPAI H7NI outbreak started on 20 October 2013 in Eastern Cape Province, and another three ostrich farms within the Blue Crane Route Local Municipality in the Eastern Cape tested positive for LPAI H7N1.On 22 May 2014, the outbreak on one of the ostrich farms was resolved. Further outbreaks on two ostrich farms were resolved at the end of June 2014. On 31 January 2014 an LPAI H7N7 outbreak was reported to the OIE.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOther outbreaks between April and June 2014 included rabies and Newcastle Disease. She reported that there was a concern for South Africa because of Rift Valley outbreak in northern Botswana, as the disease might spread to South Africa. She reported further outbreaks of Bovine Brucellosis and Tuberculosis and said that the Directorate of Animal Health, in cooperation with the provincial Veterinary Services, had established working groups to review the control of the diseases.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Proposed legislation following Constitutional Court judgment</strong><br />\r\n\tDr Boitshoko Ntshabele, President, South African Veterinary Services, then reported to the Committee on the progress made on the Performing Animals Amendment Bill. The Bill was presented to the economic sectors, employment and Infrastructure development (ESEID) Director-General&#39;s cluster, which approved that the Bill be presented to Cabinet. A Cabinet memorandum had been drafted and the Department together with the Deputy Chief State Law Advisor in the Department, had approached the Constitutional Court with a request to extend the period of validity of sections 2 and 3 of the Performing Animals Protection Act.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe added that the regulations relating to Compulsory Community Service (CCS) for veterinarians were finalised by the Department, but could not be certified by the Office of the Chief State Law Advisor because of differences of opinion on section 43 and the newly inserted section 20A of the principal Act. The Chief State Law Advisor was of the opinion that the section was unconstitutional and proposeds that the regulations be redrafted, which the Department was currently doing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong><em>Discussion</em></strong><br />\r\n\tMr Z Mandela (ANC) thanked the Department for the report. He sought clarity on how regularly the contact with farms should be, particularly in communal areas. He asked whether there were processing facilities in the former Transkei area, and, if so, where these were located and how often there was contact in those areas. He also asked whether there was a good laboratory network in the former Transkei, and, if so, where it was located - if there was none, then he asked for an explanation on this also.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Mandela wanted to know how the Department was communicating with small and communal farms, with specific reference to the Eastern Cape.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Mandela referred to slide 11 on stakeholder consultations, and wanted information on where the consultations were held and the stakeholders who represented small farmers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Mandela asked why the Department stopped producing a vaccine, when there were institutions like Agricultural Research Council (ARC). He said the Avian Influenza outbreak was reported in 2011 and resolved in 2013, and asked if this was properly described as an outbreak or a disaster. He wondered why the response time was so long. He said that rabies was not monitored particularly in communal areas, and asked what the Department was doing to replicate the success story of Kwazulu Natal, in eliminating rabies in other areas. He was concerned about the recent outbreak of cat flu that has seen a lot of breeders suffering, and requested the Department to inform the Committee of where this outbreak had occurred.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs A Steyn (DA) was thankful that the report deeply analysed the issues at hand. She was pleased also to note the presence of the Deputy Minister, since the Ministry was not often represented at meetings. She urged the Department to act stringently and urgently on the foot and mouth disease oubreaks, the issue with the Amendment Act, and sorting out issues of delegations and authority between provinces and departments. She asked whether the Department was doing everything in its power, under the current legislation. Following up on Mr Mandela&#39;s question on cat flu, she asked for a full report on all notifiable and controlled diseases.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Steyn said she was extremely concerned as to why the Department stopped manufacturing vaccines, despite the fact that so many diseases were out of control, not just Brucellosis, Rift Valley Fever and Avian Influenza.She said that most diseases were under-reported and in most instances, when nothing was done about outbreaks, people stopped reporting on them. She asked whether the Department had the two reports that were requested during the 2010-2011 outbreak of Rift Valley Fever. In relation to brucellosis she asked about the manual used to control the disease, and why there was seemingly no control, and asked what the problem was. She also asked the Department to look into the reports that some farmers, particularly on the small farms, were injecting animals with vaccines which were not refrigerated.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Steyn asked for more detail on the opinion of the legal advisor to the Department on the proposed Amendment Act and regulations in respect of the veterinarians&#39; service, and also asked the Department to clarify when it had become aware of the problem of implementing the Performing Animal Protection Act.<br />\r\n\tShe asked whether the Department had any incentives in place to encourage students to pursue veterinary medicine, and for those who qualified to work in rural areas.</p>\r\n<p>Mr C Maxegwana (ANC) thanked the Department for the presentation and welcomed the Deputy Minister. He asked to be enlightened on what the acronym &quot;OIE&quot; meant. He proposed that the Department needed to carry out an awareness drive, because animals were dying due to people&rsquo;s ignorance on what course of action to follow when diseases broke out. Referring to slide 7, he noted that the OIE experts found that there was lack of technical independence particularly at abattoirs, and recommended that technical independence should be re-established for food safety. He asked for clarification on this finding and recommendation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr T Ramokhoase (ANC) asked whether the MINMEC (Ministers, Members and Executive council) structure established under the Constitution to minimise delays in government was working as expected.&nbsp; He suggested that special communications tools needed to be established, to ensure that implementation was happening in different provinces.</p>\r\n<p>Ms D Carter (ANC) thanked the Department for the detailed presentation, and also intimated that &quot;it is a breath of fresh air to have the Deputy Minister attend the meeting&quot;. She said that there needed to be awareness on the Performing Animals Protection Act to help people understand the protections. She expressed concern on the channel of communication between the Departmental representatives on the agricultural councils and asked the Department to inform the Committee on what kind of feedback it was getting, if any. She also requested a breakdown of expenses of the representatives, which included monthly earnings and, legal fees, and she wondered if this person was representing the Department at all.</p>\r\n<p>The Chairperson applauded the report insofar as the disease-free status was concerned, and said that this was indicative of the fact that the Department was working. She asked, however, for an assurance that when the OIE carried out a follow up mission in December, it would show forward, and not backward movement. She asked what the institutional arrangement was between public and private veterinarians. She wondered if the Department had enough staff on the ground to respond to the challenges of FMD. She urged the need to educate communities, because if South Africa did not deal with management of these diseases, it would affect small farmers in the villages who relied on cattle as part of their income. She asked where there were mobile clinics from the Department, and pointed out that she had never seen them in her province of Limpopo. She pointed out that manufacturing of vaccines was still a problem and yet there was an entity in charge of that, so she wondered if the problems were problems around resources or researchers. She wondered who must enforce the institutional arrangements, so that those who were doing research were able to respond to the challenges in the country. She asked for more information on primary healthcare of animals. She also asked how the Department hoped to legislate so that those benefiting from government funding were able to pay back to the community.</p>\r\n<p>The Deputy Minister thanked the Portfolio Committee for establishing a good working relationship with the Department. Referring to comments by Members, he maintained that his Ministry hads an open door policy with all stakeholders and advised the Committee that if issues came up any Member was free to address them to the Ministry without waiting for Departmental meetings.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Cele said that communication was an obligation on the part of government, although the Department took direct responsibility, and called it social mobilisation, under which the department and stakeholders should be at par even at the lowest community level. The Department pledged to continue going forward with the advice on the issue from the Committee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Cele confirmed that, in regard to animal health, some issues cannot be handled by the Department alone, as most of the issues needed an integrated approach and there were departments created specifically to carry that approach forward.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Cele reminded Members that the Department&#39;s functions were split between provinces and the national level, and sometimes it might happen that the Department lost some control on what was happening, and he described it as a &quot;post office&quot; in relation to the grants and some other matters. The provinces were involved, constitutionally speaking. The Department was working on a system, with the Cchief Financial Officer, whereby the provinces would have to account for the money received from the Ddepartment, and show results of work done before they could be given more money.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Mooketsa asked the Committee to look at where the Department had come from, and not look at the presentation in isolation from other interventions of government. The mandate of the Department included food security, job creation and contribution to the GDP. He highlighted the Agriculture Policy Action Plan of the Department, which had two interventions which addressed the issues being discussed, the red meat value chain and poultry value chain. The two value chains were supported by a transversal intervention called bio-security, which dealt with disease control.</p>\r\n<p>In regard to animal primary health care, interventions were being made in State Owned Companies like Onderstepoort Biological Products (OBP) to recaptilise to ensure improvement in the current assets so that the restructuring could go on well.OBP made a presentation to the Department and admitted to vaccination problems, which were caused by capitalisation issues. He said that he discussed with the CEO of OBP the availability and distribution of vaccines and there were strategies in place to address those issues.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Cele conceded that, on the issue of departmental representation, Ms Carter raised a very pertinent point. A policy had been put in place whereby full reporting would be made on issues where the Department was represented.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Cele reminded Members that in the Department&rsquo;s last presentation before the Committee, it was noted that the Department essentially had two options for the compulsory veterinarians&#39; service; either to tmend the entire Act or concentrate on sections 2 and 3 of the Act. The Department decided to concentrate on the latter.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Cele said that he would share the report and advice on brucellosis in the Free State, at a later stage. He also committed himsef to share the opinion from the legal advisor on the Performing Animals Protection Act with the Committee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Cele promised, on behalf of the Department, to remain committed to raising awareness, with the help of the unit formed to manage promotion and awareness activities.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Cele noted, in relation to the alignment between the OBP and the Agricultural Support Programme, that there were some concerns about the equipment and commercialisation being done through OBP. The Director General, Minister and Deputy Minister were now working on that, to make sure that all the enterprises had a shareholder contact with the Minister, in line with the objectives of the current government.</p>\r\n<p>Dr Maja noted that the FMD free status was considered as permanent for the moment, but that OIE was coming in December to verify the assurances that the Ddepartment outlined in the addendum submitted last year, and to make sure the integrity of the free zone was not compromised. The current outbreak in Mpumalanga was in the protection zone, which fell outside the free zone, so it did not affect the FMD free status. She assured the Committee that the Department was working hard on the issues to ensure that there would be no unpleasant surprises in December.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDr Maja confirmed that the acronym OIE was the abbreviation of the French title Office International de Maladies Exotique, and that this body was formed in 1924. When other non-French speaking countries joined, the organisation adopted its alternative name of World Organization for Animal Health, but the original abbreviation was retained.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Maja addressed the questions around the avian influenza vaccine, and noted that the Department prohibited vaccination of avian influenza to animals. The other vaccines were supposed to be available. The Department was trying to limit the impact of avian influenza in the population, by developing and designing bio security requirements which aimed to discourage attracting wild birds to the farms. The Department had come up with creative ways of preventing wild birds from coming on to farms, and although this was difficult, it was possible.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDr Maja confirmed that unfortunately none of the provinces in the country was free from rabies. The Department agreed with the recommendation of the Committee on improving awareness. The Department had an advisory committee dealing with rabies and one of the issues was the vaccine for rabies. It was looking at more effective ways of vaccinating animals, for example through bait that would result in the animals being vaccinated as they took the bait.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWith regard to the Brucellosis and Tuberculosis manuals, Dr Maja reaffirmed that she had not intended to suggest that the control manuals were no longer used; they were indeed still in use.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Ntshabele answered the question on primary animal health care, and confirmed that this campaign was launched last year in October by the President and the roll out included the handing over of mobile tools, big trucks and small mini vans. In regards to awareness, DAFF spent around R2 million in the last months in partnership with the Veterinary Council, the University of Pretoria and the Veterinary Association, on campaigns on food safety and food security. The campaigns were run on television. There was one meant to promote the veterinary profession called &ldquo;choose joy&rdquo;, that emphasised the ability to work out in the field, the whole day and enjoy sunlight and fresh air.</p>\r\n<p>He pointed out the overwhelming challenge in the veterinary service was that although the country had 53 million people, there were only 3 500 veterinarians. He implored the Committee to take this very seriously when giving thought to what the Department was actually able to do. He compared these statistics to New Zealand, where the population was only 4 million people, but the country produced 100 veterinary doctors a year. The Department&rsquo;s paradigm was to get traditional faculties to be more proactive in this respect.</p>\r\n<p>He confirmed that it was important for the public and private veterinary practitioners to come together in order to achieve more, and said that against that background, the Department was working on a tool aimed at bringing together all veterinary doctors. For example, diseases like rabies required multiple stakeholders such as Departments of Education, Social Development, Health and Agriculture, to work together.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Ntshabele confirmed that each province had a laboratory, and the only challenge was lack of capacity, in terms of equipment and qualifications of people working in the laboratories, because the equipment was very expensive and government had a challenge in maintaining the laboratories.</p>\r\n<p>Dr Modisane addressed the committee on the institutional arrangement. Veterinary Services tried to limit the kind of institutional arrangements that were in place, in terms of intergovernmental interventions. MINMEC has established a structure called MINMEC Veterinary Watching Group that discussed only veterinary matters of national interest. They held quarterly meetings. However, over and above that there were also committees that were established to address particular diseases such as tuberculosis, rabies and foot and mouth disease. The committees sat on a regular basis and reported their findings to the Veterinary Services. In relation to communication, the Department had a national campaign in which everyone is invited to participate, in order to be educated on the diseases. Speaking to the categorisation of diseases, he noted that there were &quot;notifiable&quot; and &quot;controlled&quot; diseases and those that were controlled were also notifiable. The Department had a full report on all the diseases, but that was information that needed to be explained to the public.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Carter asked whether there is a proposal on how the Department was going to move forward in terms of 2015 licensing. She gave an example that students might be denied entry into veterinary school, but register in another field, perhaps becoming very successful neuro surgeons. That issue needed to be addressed.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Steyn commented, in relation to employment equity, that it was not enough for the Department to mention the number of veterinarians in the country. The Department needed to do something about the situation. She hoped that further questions from herself and Ms Carter would be answered in another engagement.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Other business: Adoption of Minutes</strong><br />\r\n\tThe Committee adopted minutes of meetings on 14, 15, 16, 17 and 23 October 2014, with amendments.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe meeting was adjourned.</p>\r\n",

        "summary": "<p>The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF), in the presence of the Deputy Minister, presented a report on livestock diseases of economic importance. South Africa had, following numerous complaints from the Red Meat Industry Forum (RMIF), invited the World Health Organization for Animal Health (OIE) to evaluate the performance of animal health in South Africa. The experts made findings on the human, physical, financial resources, technical authority, capability, interaction with interested parties and access to markets. OIE cautioned that although the Veterinary Services of South Africa were still of a generally high standard, they stood at a cross roads between a bright future and a rapid decline. OIE made recommendations which included that Veterinary Services should establish a clear strategy, policy and supportive measures to develop a more comprehensive network of veterinarians in the field with regular contact with farms and animals. The experts pointed to a break in the chain of command between&nbsp; national and provincial governments, and said that a clear strategy and supportive measures were needed. They commented that, from a technical point of view, there was a good laboratory network, but not enough technical independence in the abbatoirs and registration process, and recommended better resourcing and dedicated staff for risk analysis. Communication with interested parties seemed to be well-supported, but did not reach out enough to the small and communal farmers, and there was not sufficient consultation with all interested parties. In particular, OIE recommended that joint programmes should be developed for important diseases. The OIE found that the internal and external quality of legislation was satisfactory, although there were not enough dedicated legal staff in the Department. International certification and transparenc would be improved by increasing the numbers of field veterinarians. It urged that improvements of the chain of command and development of a comprehensive system would allow the Veterinary Services to move in a positive direction. The recommendations and progress made on these of the Provincial Veterinary Services Report were outlined.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Department noted that South Africa regained its Foot and Mouth Disease Free Status in February 2014, and although there would be a follow up from the OIE in December, South Africa was confident that it would retain its status, and had implemented the conditions. Although there had been some other outbreaks these happened in the protected zones. The Department also described the outbreaks of avian flu, rabies, and Newcastle Disease, and highlighted that there were some concerns about the possible spread of Rift Valley disease from Botswana. The Department was working on control of all diseases. Finally, the Department reported that it was dealing with the Performing Animals Amendment Bill amendments, and that there was work ongoing also to resolve the disagreement between the Departmental and Chief State Law Advisors on the constitutionality of regulations for compulsory community service for veterinarians.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMembers commended the Department on the updates, and were pleased to see the Deputy Minister present to contribute. They were pleased to hear of the redemption of status for exports, but wondered why this had taken some time. Major areas of concern for Members included the shortage of veterinarians in regular contact with farms and animals, the break in chain of command between national and provincial government departments, the fact that the communication was not addreasing small holders and communal farms, and the failure to update legislation regularly. Members proposed an awareness campaign to educate communities on some of these diseases and a career incentive to encourage students at the university to study veterinary medicine. They also asked for more clarity on the vaccine situation. Some answers and reports would be provided to the Committee at a later stage.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

They may investigate any matter of public interest that falls within their area of responsibility. There is a Portfolio Committee for each national Ministry and its associated government department/s.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Select Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Council of Provinces (NCOP) appoints from its permanent members a number of Select Committees to shadow the work of the various national government departments and to deal with Bills.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause only 54 of the 90 NCOP Members are permanent delegates compared to the 400 of the NA, the Select Committees oversee the work of more than one national government department.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Public Accounts Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Assembly Standing Committee on Public Accounts acts as Parliament&#39;s watchdog over the way taxpayers&#39; money is spent by the Executive. Every year the Auditor-General tables reports on the accounts and financial management of the various government departments and State institutions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHeads of government departments and institutions are regularly called by this committee to report and account for expenditure.

The Committees normally consist of senior Members of Parliament. The Rules Committee and its sub-committees deal with House rules, the budget of the House, support for Members, internal arrangements, and powers and privileges of members. Other internal Committees are the Programme Committee that plans the work of the Assembly, the Disciplinary Committee, and the Committee of Chairpersons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe National Council of Provinces has its own domestic Committees.

        "body": "<p>The Chairperson went through the agenda for the meeting, and announced the apologies from absent Committee members, many of whom had other meetings to attend. The representatives from the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) were welcomed. Committee Members and staff were asked to stay for ten minutes after the briefings, for a short meeting to discuss the programme for Thursday.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>National Agricultural Marketing Council on the Strategic Infrastructure Project 11 (SIP 11)</strong><br />\r\n\tDr Simphiwe Ngqangweni, Senior Manager for Markets and Economic Research, National Agricultural Marketing Council (NAMC), presented the strategic infrastructure project (SIP) together with Mr Ronald Ramabulana, Chief Executive Officer of the NAMC. Professor Edith Vries, Director General of DAFF, was also present for the briefing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDr Ngqangweni discussed the outline of the presentation and explained how it had been put together, and why certain parts were not included. The SIP guiding policies and Acts were the National Development Plan (NDP), Infrastructure Development Plan (IDP), Infrastructure Development Act, 2014, and the Presidential Infrastructure Development Commission (PICC). All the policies and Acts allowed for the proper implementation of SIPs, and it was also a way for the Department to get funding for the projects.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe governance structure of the PICC consisted of the Council, Manco, the Secretariat and the task team. The Council comprises Cabinet Ministers, Premiers and Executive Mayors, and considers the performance dashboards of every SIP, reports to Cabinet and recommends policy changes to the Cabinet. The Manco consists of a number of key Ministers, and they monitor the development plan and ensure coordinated regulatory approvals. The Ministers also support the Secretariat, while the Deputy Ministers oversee the day-to-day activities of the technical team.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe presenter went through each of the SIPs in detail and explained where they were situated, and in which areas they had started operations. There had been difficulty with the implementation of some of the projects due to a lack of rural infrastructure, a lack of connectivity of rural areas and insufficient rail capacity, to name just a few.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Ramabulana said the SIPs had been focused mainly on the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Limpopo, because they had the most rural locations where no activities were taking place. The Western Cape and Gauteng province had the least focused areas. The SIPs had been constructed in phases. For the first phase, the value of the projects had cost the Department R1 127&nbsp;931, with a total of 34 643 jobs created, and the second phase had cost R2 769&nbsp;497, with 20&nbsp;095 jobs created. The conceptual and planning phase included all projects that were at the conceptual, planning, tendering, advertising and re-advertising stages.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome of the SIPs&#39; challenges were that there were inconsistencies with reporting, especially on the development stages of the construction, there were too many gaps in the provincial reports, and provincial report were submitted late. The successes were that they had developed a SIP 11 business plan, and certain provinces had been reported to be doing well with the projects. There had been two Cabinet reports thus far, showing that all stakeholders involved were committed to the projects and some activity was taking place.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong><em>Discussion</em></strong><br />\r\n\tMr T Ramokhoase (ANC) said that the SIPs were part of the NDP, but the report stated that there had been problems with the funding of some of the projects. How was that possible when the Minister of Finance included the projects in the budget each year? To what extent did monitoring and evaluation influence changes in the projects?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs A Steyn (DA) said the Department could not implement SIPs in phases, because it would cost more money. The equipment used to construct the projects had become damaged and vandalised when they had been left on the sites. Why had they decided to construct these projects in some areas, and not others, and what criteria had been used to select areas for the projects?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Z Mandela (ANC) asked in which area the National Red Meat Development Project in the Eastern Cape was being constructed. When would they start and how long would it take to complete. He also asked who was responsible for the Ncorha project, and how much money was being spent on it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Z Jongbloed (DA) said she had never heard a decent presentation from the DAFF. The presentation had no detail, and there was no fiscal commitment for the projects.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Ramabulana responded that they did have a detailed report on each of the SIPs, and the Committee was welcome to visit the sites where construction was taking place. On the issue of choosing areas, they had used employment and agricultural criteria, looking at the employment potential and agricultural growth of the area before deciding to start construction. They were also trying to get the private sector involved in the projects, especially with regard to funding.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries on the Mechanisation Policy</strong><br />\r\n\tMr Mokutule Kgobokoe, Deputy Director General: Food Security and Agrarian Reform (FSAR), gave a background history to explain how the Department had come to formulate the policy and why it had been necessary for them to do so. The majority of food producers could not afford mechanisation due to the economies of scale and the costs of maintaining the machinery (fuel, operation, purchasing costs), and there was also a lack of technical skills to operate the machinery. The objectives of the policy were to ensure the provision of an affordable mechanisation service to producers with access to viable natural resources, to unlock the potential of under-utilized agricultural resources, to increase food production and reduce poverty and under-development, and to promote local economic beneficiation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe guiding principles and legislative mandates were what would help manage the policy. Some of the legislative mandates were the Constitution of the Republic, the Public Finance Management Act, the National Veld and Forest Fire Act, the Occupational Health and Safety Act, and the Skills Development Act. The document also included the general conditions of support for farmers, how and when monitoring and evaluation would take place, and a conclusion detailing the way forward with the policy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong><em>Discussion</em></strong><br />\r\n\tMr Ramokhoase asked if the State was financially able to provide the machinery to implement the policy. Was the Department willing to first test the policy in a few areas before implementing it across the country, to see if it would work?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr C Maxegwana (ANC) said more research had to be done, and they needed to talk to the people who would be benefiting from the policy before the implementation stage started.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Steyn agreed with Mr Maxegwana, saying that the policy could not be implemented without speaking first to the farmers. She asked if the support from the government would increase productivity.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Mandela asked for feedback on the investigation that had been made into an official who had stolen a tractor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson said that traditional leaders in the rural areas used tractors as a means to punish farmers who had not paid their levies. They withhold them from the workers, or farmers, and they are not able to produce food.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Kgobooe responded that they needed to consult with the state. They had taken note of all the questions and would get back to the Committee with responses as soon as they have consulted and retrieved the relevant documents.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>DAFF on its proposed accession to three international fisheries bodies</strong><br />\r\n\tMr Mortimer Mannya, Deputy Director General of Fisheries -- who was later joined by the Minister, Mr Senzeni Zokwana -- presented on the Department&#39;s proposed accession to three international fisheries bodies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Agreement for the establishment of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) was an intergovernmental regional fisheries management organisation (RFMO), mandated to manage tuna and tuna-like species in the Indian Ocean. South Africa&#39;s long line fishing effort for tuna were originally developed in the Atlantic in 1998, but had since 2002 expanded to include the Indian Ocean. Currently, most of South Africa&rsquo;s long line fishing effort was focused on the Indian Ocean, where catch rates were higher.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAcceding to the Convention for the Conservation of the Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) would greatly improve South Africa&#39;s negotiating position for more equitable southern bluefin quotas, as all management decisions -- including country allocations -- were based on 100% consensus by member parties.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRegarding the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Port State Measures Agreement to prevent, deter and eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing, establishing a network of ports adopting port state measures was regarded as the most cost-effective means of combating IUU fishing. It would also protect South Africa&rsquo;s resources and markets by not allowing access for illegal fish products often threatening the livelihood of South Africa&#39;s national fishing industry.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong><em>Discussion</em></strong><br />\r\n\tMr Ramokhoase asked what the conditions of being an associate member were.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Jongbloed said the Department should provide them with a list of all the acronyms and abbreviations they had used in the documents.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Mandela asked about the security at the different shores, and wanted to know how South Africa was going to ensure there was no illegal fishing taking place off our shores.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson reminded the Committee that this briefing would not include questions. Members should ask questions only for clarity&rsquo;s sake. They had agreed upon a day on which they would ask the Department questions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Minister said that being an associate member meant you were limited to an amount of time while fishing, and there were some areas where you were permitted to fish. One could not cast votes when the Commission had to make important decisions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson asked which organisation would represent SA on the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Mannya said no organisation would join on behalf of SA, but SA would join as a country.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong><em>Committee Programme</em></strong><br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson asked if the Members understood the programme for the week, and asked for the adoption of the Committee Programme. Ms Steyn and Mr Ramokhoase proposed its adoption.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson thanked the Members and the representatives from the Department.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe meeting was adjourned.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "summary": "<p>The National Agricultural Marketing Council (NAMC) presented on the SIP 11 projects, and their relationship to the National Development Plan, the Infrastructure Development Plan and the Presidential Infrastructure Development Commission. The Committee was told about the funding, the location of the projects, and who would be part of the governance structure. There had been difficulty with the implementation of some of the projects due to a lack of rural infrastructure, a lack of connectivity of rural areas and insufficient rail capacity. The SIPs had been focused mainly on the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Limpopo, because they had the most rural locations where no activities were taking place.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMembers asked how some projects were not able to be funded when a detailed budget had been set aside for them.

DAFF needed to talk to the people who would be benefiting from the policy before the implementation stage started. The policy could not be implemented without speaking first to the farmers. Would support from the government increase productivity?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDAFF&#39;s third briefing provided reasons why accession to the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), The Convention for the Conservation of the Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) and The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Port State Measures Agreement to prevent, deter and eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing would be good for South Africa. However, Members were concerned about what it meant to be an associate member, the safety of the country&rsquo;s shores and the terminology in the presentation.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

There is a Portfolio Committee for each national Ministry and its associated government department/s.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Select Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Council of Provinces (NCOP) appoints from its permanent members a number of Select Committees to shadow the work of the various national government departments and to deal with Bills.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause only 54 of the 90 NCOP Members are permanent delegates compared to the 400 of the NA, the Select Committees oversee the work of more than one national government department.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Public Accounts Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Assembly Standing Committee on Public Accounts acts as Parliament&#39;s watchdog over the way taxpayers&#39; money is spent by the Executive. Every year the Auditor-General tables reports on the accounts and financial management of the various government departments and State institutions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHeads of government departments and institutions are regularly called by this committee to report and account for expenditure. The Committee can recommend that the National Assembly takes corrective actions if necessary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Members&#39; Legislative Proposals and Petitions Committees</strong><br />\r\nDraft bills can be submitted by individual Members of the National Assembly. These bills are considered by the National Assembly&#39;s Standing Committee on Private Member&#39;s Legislative Proposals and Special Petitions. If the Committee agrees with the principle of the draft Bill, a Bill will be prepared and dealt with by Parliament.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe National Council of Provinces Select Committee on Members&#39; and Provincial Legislative Proposals considers draft Bills from individual NCOP members and provincial legislatures.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPetitions may also be tabled in Parliament and referred to the relevant committee that deals with the issue raised in the petition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Internal Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Assembly has a number of internal committees that deal with matters affecting the running of Parliament. The Committees normally consist of senior Members of Parliament. The Rules Committee and its sub-committees deal with House rules, the budget of the House, support for Members, internal arrangements, and powers and privileges of members. Other internal Committees are the Programme Committee that plans the work of the Assembly, the Disciplinary Committee, and the Committee of Chairpersons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe National Council of Provinces has its own domestic Committees. The Rules Committee and its subcommittees deal with the NCOP rules, the NCOP budget, parliamentary privileges, internal arrangements, international relations and delegated legislation. The Programme Committee plans the work of the NCOP and the Committee of Chairpersons make recommendations about the functioning of Committees and other NCOP forums.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Ad hoc Committees</strong><br />\r\nParliament or one of its Houses may appoint an ad hoc (temporary) Committee when a special task must be done. When the task is complete, the Committee is dissolved.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Joint Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces together appoint a number of joint committees, for example the Constitutional Review Committee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and the Joint Standing Committee on Defence are statutory Committees. This means that they are established, by the Constitution or by an Act of Parliament, as well as in terms of the rules of Parliament.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe committees play a very important role in the process of building democracy and involving the public in the processes and activities of Parliament.</p>\r\n",

        "body": "<p><strong>Marine Living Resources Fund (MLRF): Questions and Answers</strong></p>\r\n<p>Ms A Steyn (DA) sought clarity on why the issue of the Threatened and Protected Species permits could not be dealt with, and remarked that the Department was rather contributing in making people poorer.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Z Jongbloed (DA) remarked that the Department should, according to the Auditor General (AG) report, hold management staff accountable for poor non-financial performance. The AG had raised concern on unfunded activities or paying for goods and services which were not budgeted for, and asked who should be liable. She sought clarity on a vessel which had been operated on a short term contract, and irregular spending arising from it, and whether certification of the vessel was in danger of being revoked. She asked about a statement made by the Minister related to the SAS Afrikaner, the Department&rsquo;s research vessel, and the outstanding issues related to research, monitoring and evaluation, as raised by the AG. With regard to performance, she sought clarity on the previous process that had been declared fraudulent and unlawful, and on the backlog of cases for which the Minister had not given a response. She said she would like to know about the forensic investigation into the procurement of goods and services, particularly when the report would be available and why the Public Protector&rsquo;s report into irregular tenders had not been tabled before the Committee. She asked whether agricultural research would be conducted, or not. Referring to the deficit appearing in the annual report, she said R44 million had been spent on transport -- what was it for? She also asked about the surplus of R39 million and irregular spending of R120 million.</p>\r\n<p>Mr C Maxegwana (ANC) sought clarity on the procurement of goods and services, and when the issue of the SAS Afrikaner would be put to rest. On the issue of joint operations between the Department and police in relation to the poachers, he remarked that there were too many arrests of people who were perceived as poachers, and said the place where a crime was committed was problematic. To guard against the poachers, the Department should ensure that poachers had no access to waters to fish illegally.</p>\r\n<p>The Chairperson sought clarity on the inland fishing strategy that had been developed, and what had been done to ensure that the strategy was implemented. Was the strategy succeeding, or was it facing some challenges? She also sought clarity on water rights and on the progress in the implementation of small scale fishing in coastal areas, and whether support was being provided to the cooperatives that had been formed.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Maxengwana that people who formed cooperatives did not know what to do, because they did not have governmental support. If communities did not benefit from the state programme, they would remain in poverty. In Limpopo, there were cooperatives, but the DDG needed to advise what should be done.</p>\r\n<p>The Chairperson sought clarity on the integration of fisheries, which had been on agenda of the Department for five years, for the purpose of having a single resource management.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Mortimer Mannya, Deputy Director General: Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) replied that fisheries was a sector that attracted a number of people. It was a competitive sector, but was not yet transformed. It had been a white dominated sector. Cooperatives had limited resources, but the Committee had higher expectations. The Department was developing aquaculture to promote fisheries.</p>\r\n<p>On issue of issuing permits, he said that it was a problem that he was dealing with it to ensure it was solved. The matter related to the supply chain management stemmed from the Department&rsquo;s internal capacity, particularly the resignation of the head.</p>\r\n<p>Referring to the vessels, he said that short term contracts had been procured and the Department had net requirements. Most of the problems were the result of irregular expenditure. He promised that the issue would be resolved by 2017. Tenders had been advertised to move away from short term strategies.</p>\r\n<p>On the question of availability of funds, the Marine Living Resources Fund (MLRF) was generating the revenue from collections it was making. The fund was viable. Some funds were allocated to deal with regulatory aspects, and developmental activities would include small initiatives, aquaculture development, and other aspects which were not necessarily regulatory. The MLRF was sitting with a large number of vacant positions, and had advertised them. There were three posts at the management level.</p>\r\n<p>There were various debates around short term contracts, but the Department had resolved that the short term contracts would continue to be used until the finalisation of tenders.</p>\r\n<p>The SAS Afrikaner was indeed not ready. There was an agreement that the service provider would repair two engines, but the vessel was very old and repairing it was difficult. There was no risk of danger with the vessels that he was aware of. Because the SAS Afrikaner was out of commission, the Department had contracted other vessels to carry out its mandate effectively. The non-operation of the SAS Afrikaner had caused under-spending. The Department also under-spent on the aquaculture project.</p>\r\n<p>Concerning the allocation of rights in 2013/14, the report had been completed and would be presented to the Committee. Tthe Minister had referred the report to the State legal advisor, and he was waiting for feedback. Once the report was released, the Department would take action based on the data base. According to the report&rsquo;s recommendations and observations, eight months were needed in order to allocate rights. The Department was committed to social transformation. It wanted to support small scale fisheries. It was dealing with finite resources, and was expecting that there might be unhappiness related to the allocation of rights, which would occur in 2015.</p>\r\n<p>With regard to the tender process, he said that the Department was involving the National Treasury to assist with the process.</p>\r\n<p>The Department had concluded nine memorandums of understanding with nine universities, and aquaculture was one area affected by those memorandums. A written report in that regard would be submitted to the Committee.</p>\r\n<p>On the availability of revenue, he said that the tariffs had not yet been reviewed. A plan was being put in place to review them, and to improve on the collection of levies and fines. Fines were collected by the Department of Justice.</p>\r\n<p>On the issue of transport costs and the procurements of goods, the Department was strengthening its internal supply chain management controls, because that was where the Department had weaknesses.</p>\r\n<p>The Department was taking measures to prevent poaching by engaging in joint initiatives and it was doing relatively well. Where there was a high degree of competition, transformation was usually slow, and where communities did not profit from the resources available to them, there would be poverty. He believed that integrated fisheries security would assist in contributing to social transformation. The Department was developing a fisheries policy which would be viable if the Department of Environment came to the table. With regard to small scale fisheries, the Department had embarked on the identification and verification of fisheries within communities, and was registering cooperatives and individuals.</p>\r\n<p>On the issue of arrests, he said that those who had been arrested were not poor people.</p>\r\n<p>With regard to aquaculture development, he said that the Department was supporting small scale fishing through provincial departments, and it was the duty of the MLRF to ensure that the funds got to beneficiaries.</p>\r\n<p>Regarding integration, he said that it would take time before it was fully implemented. To be implemented, it would require a review of the legislation. In this regard, external support was needed.</p>\r\n<p>The Chairperson said that the Committee would continue to engage with the Department on the issue of integration of fisheries, and stressed that this needed to be done within next two years.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Steyn said that the DDG was not in a position to answer some questions posed by the Members. They should have been answered by the Minister, or Deputy Minister.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Mannya replied that the Minister and Deputy Minister could not account to the Committee because they had had to attend a meeting with the World Food Programme and Agri-US Conference in Limpopo. In this respect, agriculture could not succeed if South Africa did not have good collaboration with international partners, so the Minister could not cancel this engagement. He was standing in on the Minister&rsquo;s behalf, as accounting officer.</p>\r\n<p>The Chairperson agreed, but said the apologies were not accepted.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Steyn reiterated that the communication was poor. The Minister was needed, because the unresolved issue of certifications was causing people to suffer.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Agricultural Research Council (ARC) on its 2013/14 Annual Report</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Chairperson called the first presenter and said that questions would follow immediately after the briefs. She requested members to write questions down on the papers. Questions were handed to presenters, after all three presentations.</p>\r\n<p>Dr Shadrack Moephuli, Chief Executive Officer: ARC, introduced the ARC Council members and proceeded to take the Committee through presentation. He said that the ARC mandate derived from the Act and its objectives were aligned to national priorities and policies. The ARC had six objectives, namely:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 18pt;\">Sustainable use and management of natural resources</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 18pt;\">Enhanced nutrition and food security</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 18pt;\">Improved ability of the sector to manage and mitigate agricultural risks</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 18pt;\">Improved efficiency and a competitive sector</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 18pt;\">Improved operational and organisational efficiency, and effectiveness</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 18pt;\">Transformed agrarian landscape</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These objectives are implemented through nine programmes, namely:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 18pt;\">Crop production, improvement and protection</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 18pt;\">Animal health, production and improvement</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 18pt;\">Mechanisation and engineering</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 18pt;\">Natural resources management</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 18pt;\">Agro-processing, food technology and safety</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 18pt;\">Smallholder agricultural development</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 18pt;\">Training and extension</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 18pt;\">Administration and corporate affairs</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Mr Moephuli referred the Committee to the Council&rsquo;s achievements and successes in terms of these programmes (see attachment). He said that the number of science publications had doubled in six years and the quality of scientific publications had improved.</p>\r\n<p>He briefed the Committee on ARC&rsquo;s employment equity status, and noted that 46% were white, 50% were black, three per cent were coloured, and one percent was Indian. Female employees made up 42% of the workforce -- 28% African, two percent Coloured, 11% white, and one percent Indian.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Gabriel Maluleke, Chief Financial Officer, briefed the Committee on the financial information.</p>\r\n<p>Revenue had grown by 23% in 2014 to R1&nbsp;363 million, compared to R1&nbsp;104 million in 2013. Operating expenditure had increased by 19%, from R1&nbsp;015 million to R1&nbsp;206 million. This had resulted in a surplus of R156 million &ndash; a 76% improvement on the previous year.</p>\r\n<p>The ARC was faced with some challenges. The Parliamentary grant had been increased by 16% to R866 million, but due to a prolonged period of inadequate funding, higher expectations and increased costs, this remained very inadequate to fulfil the Council&rsquo;s mandate. There was ageing infrastructure with a high need for replacement and repair, and limited funds were available for capital expenditure. There was limited funding to fill the required number of critical vacancies. Staff retention was a challenge due to non-market related pay scales. Investment by the private sector was limited.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Ondersterpoort Biological Products (OBP) on its 2013/14 Annual Report</strong></p>\r\n<p>Dr Steven P Cornelius, Chief Executive Officer, introduced his team and proceeded to provide a historical background. The Onderstepoort Veterinary Research Institute (OVRI) was established in 1908. In 1992, it had separated from OVRI, which became part of the ARC. It was incorporated in 2000 and received funding of R9 million in 2001. By 2011, revenue exceeded R161 million. Today, the total workforce was 176 permanent employees.</p>\r\n<p>With regards to performance report, OBP had five strategic objectives:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 18pt;\">Build a successful and high performance organisation</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 18pt;\">Improve business processes and management practices</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 18pt;\">Build a profitable and sustainable economy</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 18pt;\">Facilitate job creation through indirectly supporting its clients and directly creating subsidiaries, joint ventures, incubating, accelerating, and spawning off new business entities</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 18pt;\">Contribute to government priorities with respect to food security and economic growth.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In the 2013/14 period, the OBP had shown an after-tax loss of R8.6m, which was a reduction from the R21.4m loss the previous financial year. The OBP would be investing in development of new vaccines and replacing critical equipment to maintain manufacturing capacity, supporting emerging sectors, and developing skills as a priority.</p>\r\n<p><strong>South African Veterinary Council (SAVC) on its 2013/14 Annual Report</strong></p>\r\n<p>Dr Boitshoko Ntshabele, President: SAVCO, said that the Council performed its core functions in line with its objectives, including regulating veterinary practice, determining the minimum standards of tuition and training, exercising effective control over the professional conduct, determining the standards of professional conduct of persons, encouraging and promoting efficiency and responsibility, protecting the interests of the veterinary and veterinary-para professions, maintaining and enhancing the prestige, status and dignity of the veterinary professions, and advising the Minister on matters connected to the profession.</p>\r\n<p>In order to promote food safety and security, four strategic goals were developed. These were relevance for the needs of the country and modern legislation, stakeholder relationships, unification of the veterinary professions, and mobilisation of resources.</p>\r\n<p>With regards to new developments, Dr Ntshabele said that in 2012 the SAVC had objected to the requirement of Threatened and Protected Species (TPS) permits for veterinarians rendering veterinary services to the TPS, and would continue to oppose such requirements because it believed that the Minister had acted beyond her powers in the introduction of such requirements.</p>\r\n<p>A total of 5 194 veterinary and veterinary para-professionals were registered with the SAVC on 31 March 2014, and 425 persons were authorised to perform veterinary or veterinary para-professional services. The administration encouraged members to register and maintain their registration.</p>\r\n<p>Dr Ntshabele concluded by indicating the SAVC&rsquo;s assets had grown to R11.7m in 2013/14, from R10.2m in 2012/13.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>Agricultural Research Council</em></p>\r\n<p>Clarity was sought on unclear issues, including why it was not possible to collaborate with other entities, given its budget constraints, how access to animal health services was ensured in cases where animal health facilities were the competence of the provinces, whether farmers were trained in Limpopo, the conversion output in terms of technological innovation and how it contributed to generation of income, and whether there was a comprehensive plan to improve animal health facilities.</p>\r\n<p>Dr Moephuli replied that the ARC was working hand in hand with various provinces, as well as the Department of Trade and Industry. Farmers in Limpopo were trained under the PlantWise programme. The ARC was the leading entity in technological innovation and research, and had generated more than R8.2 million in this area.</p>\r\n<p>On plans to improve animal health services, he replied that these had been linked to plans to provide expertise on animal health, and how to cure certain diseases. The ARC still had to sit with the Department to enter into a formal agreement for the Council to be able to deliver. The ARC had visited various facilities and hoped to be informed of any problems related to facilities or services requiring improvement.</p>\r\n<p>On the question related to an increase in Parliamentary grants, he said that an increase was needed because of the competitive market situation.</p>\r\n<p>On the issue of maintaining property, he said that the ARC was facing a shortage of skilled staff, and R80 million had been allocated to maintenance. However, R150 million was needed to deal with backlogs. R70 million had been spent on security costs. Electricity costs were standing at R50 million, which was a major expense.</p>\r\n<p>On the question of what the ARC could do when there was no vaccine, he replied that nothing could be done if no vaccine was available. ARC had to ensure that it had vaccines at all times.</p>\r\n<p>Regarding what the ARC was doing in terms of contributing to climate change, he replied that it had made a presentation on the matter, illustrating changes and shifts in rainfalls, and a strategic plan that could provide a response to climate change.</p>\r\n<p><em>Onderstepoort Biological Products</em></p>\r\n<p>Asked whether smallholder farmers were also buyers of OBD products, Dr Cornelius responded that the OBD income stream came mainly from white farmers. To smallholder farmers, the OBD sold less than a million products, simply because they had no money. They received products through subsidy schemes. However, the number of commercial farmers had dropped and smallholder farmers were on the rise, so the OBD&rsquo;s future growth would depend on small scale farmers.</p>\r\n<p>Regarding how the OBD would maintain efficiency, he replied that there had been some changes in terms of upgrading manufacturing facilities. Money received from National Treasury was not sufficient. If the OBD could upgrade its facilities, it could maintain its efficiency. It had defined its weaknesses, and how to improve on them. Upgrading a facility could take about six years and building a new facility could take two years.</p>\r\n<p>Dr Cornelius remarked that some questions could be made clearer if the Members of the Committee were on site. A site visit was suggested, as it was essential for Members to understand what the OBD was doing.</p>\r\n<p>Dr Cornelius agreed that the OBD could be threatened by the birth of competitors in the industry, and there were other medicine manufacturers in the region that were also a threat. What was needed was the support of government to ensure it remained competitive and efficient. The OBD had 53 vaccines, but only four vaccines were not manufactured by other medicine manufacturers. The main challenge that OBD was facing was having to use old equipment. It was the manufacturing equipment of the 1990s. New equipment was needed. Upgrading might take at least between six to ten years.</p>\r\n<p>He concluded that if the OBD had no vaccines, it could place an order to other medicine manufacturers. There was staff in marketing who worked on the basis of commission.</p>\r\n<p><em>South African Veterinary Council</em></p>\r\n<p>Considering that It was the first time the SAVC had briefed the Committee, the Chairperson apologised for not allocating enough time to the Council, and remarked that it was not deliberate, but was due to the Committee&rsquo;s time constraints.</p>\r\n<p>Dr Ntshabele accepted the apology. On the question relating to audit statements in respect of short-term investments and accrued interest, he replied that he had received financial reports and there had been various meetings to determine the gaps in the investments. With regards to complying with reporting in terms of financial frameworks, he said that the SAVC was reporting to relevant institutions.</p>\r\n<p>Regarding community services, he said that the SAVC was engaging the Department in pushing for an amendment to the regulatory framework. There were gaps that were needed to be closed. The proposal was sitting with the Department, which had sent it to the state legal advisor to seek his or her opinion. Some officials were of the view that the gaps should be addressed by an amendment to the legislation, while others were objecting. Different opinions became problematic.</p>\r\n<p>On the issue of non-availability of vaccines, he replied that it would be a devastating situation if there was no vaccination. Vaccines ought to be available, especially at critical times or when they were needed most. The spread of animal diseases was due to the absence of animals for vaccination. Animals were expected to be vaccinated at particular weeks or months from their births, and if a vaccination was missed, in some cases it could not be vaccinated at a later stage. A vaccination facility could not be closed at a critical time, otherwise it would be a disaster for animal health services in South Africa.</p>\r\n<p>The meeting was adjourned.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

These included the future of the SAS Afrikaner research vessel, which remained out of commission, the approach to dealing with poachers, irregular tenders and weaknesses in supply chain management, the DAFF&rsquo;s inland fishing strategy and its support for cooperatives, the strategy for developing aquaculture, and the allocation of fishing rights and review of tariffs.</p>\r\n<p>The Agricultural Research Council (ARC) said that the number of its science publications had doubled in six years, and the quality of scientific publications had improved.

With regard to new developments, the SAVC had objected in 2012 to the requirement of Threatened and Protected Species (TPS) permits for veterinarians rendering veterinary services to the TPS, and would continue to oppose such requirements, because it believed that the Minister had acted beyond her powers in the introduction of such a requirement. A total of 5 194 veterinary and veterinary para-professionals were registered with the SAVC on 31 March 2014, and 425 persons were authorised to perform veterinary or veterinary para-professional services. The administration encouraged members to register and maintain their registration.</p>\r\n<p>During interaction with Members, ARC dealt with the need to collaborate with other entities to overcome budget constraints, the training of farmers in Limpopo, how access to animal health facilities was ensured, and what ARC could do when vaccines were not available. The OBP indicated that funding was need to upgrade old facilities, and acknowledged that competition from other medicine manufacturers posed a threat. The SAVC said vaccination was essential to prevent the spread of animal diseases, and gaps in the regulatory framework needed to be closed.</p>\r\n",

        "body": "<p><strong>Overview of Annual Report for DAFF</strong><br />\r\n\tMs Nontobeko Qwabe, Researcher: Parliament, briefed the Committee on the overview of the annual report of DAFF for the 2013/14 financial year. The department had a total of 37 targets and achieved on 25 of these. Various reasons were given for over performance or non-performance and these include the involvement of other departments, provinces utilizing their equitable share, appropriate supporting documents as well as poor planning. DAFF was appropriated a total amount of R6.18 billion in the 2013/14 FY which was almost R320 million more than the R5.86 billion that was appropriated in the 2012/2013 FY. The Department spent 98.8% of its appropriated budget in 2013/14.Over 77% of the Department&rsquo;s budget was spent between three programmes namely, Programme 2,Agricultural production, Health and Food safety(32.74%) and Programme 3,Food Security and Agrarian Reform(26.01%) and Programme 5,Forestry and Natural Resources Management(18.7%). An amount of R2.15 billion (34.75% of total appropriation) was transferred to provinces for conditional grants; and R1.37 billion (22.21 % of total appropriation) was allocated to public entities. Almost 70% of the transfer to public entities was to the ARC and almost 19% to MLRF. The Department also transferred an amount of R169.28 million to public corporations. The Department had managed to transfer 100% of the allocated funds to its entities. The Department&rsquo;s revenue increased to R809 million in the reporting year compared to the 2012/13 financial year&rsquo;s R198 million due to the R637.2million of unspent conditional grants and project received from provinces and Land Bank.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Department spent 98.8% of its appropriation funds and had only achieved 67% of the planned targets in the five programmes considered in this analysis-<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Programme1: Administration</em><br />\r\n\t11 targets were met out of 15 targets that were supposed to be achieved under this programme. The department had failed to achieve 100% adherence target.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Programme 2: Agricultural Production, Health and Food Safety</em><br />\r\n\tThe programmed achieved 5 targets out of the 6 targets for 2013/14 FY;&nbsp; the department had not met its target on conservation of 2 indigenous animal species. The department must indicate if there was economic benefit that could be derived and if there were any plans to promote species propagation in this regard.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Programme 3: Food Security and Agrarian Reform</em><br />\r\n\tThe department achieved 3 out of the 4 targets set for 2013/14<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Programme 4: Economic Developed, Trade and Marketing</em><br />\r\n\tThe department fully achieved three of the seven targets that were planned for the 2013/14 FY.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Programme 5: Forestry and natural Resources Management</em><br />\r\n\tThe Department had planned five targets for this programme only three were achieved.</p>\r\n<p><em>Programme 6: Fisheries Management</em><br />\r\n\tThis programme is anlaysed separately by MLRF.</p>\r\n<p>The Department had no audit committee for the majority of the financial year under review. The Department indicated that its internal control was adequate and effective. The audit committee acknowledges that because there was no risk assessment performed for the Department, the internal audit plan was not risk based. The Department received an unqualified audit opinion from the AG with a correction on the financial statements of prior period error(2012/13 year end) on the impairment of accrued departmental revenue due to agriculture debt account to the tune of R58 million. It is highly imperative that the Department maintained realistic planning that could be implemented in line with the broader government outcomes. Issues for consideration include- &nbsp;lack of internal controls and unreliability of reported performance information, lack of leadership as well as flaunting of treasury regulations and PFMA which had been raised by the AG in the past financial years and&nbsp; still recurred. The capability of the Department to remedy issues raised in the report of the AG seemed uncertain.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Overview of the 2013/14 Annual Report for MLRF and the Fisheries Management Branch</strong></p>\r\n<p>Mr Joseph Ginindza, Researcher: Parliament briefed the Committee on the analysis of the 2013/14 MLRF annual report. There were some levels of inconsistencies in the way targets, indicators and outputs were structured between the 2013/14 strategic plan and the 2013/14 MLRF annual reports which impacted on the targets set. The reporting of some actual achievements was confusing particularly when reading both the Annual report of the Department and the annual report of the MLRF. Inspections at the airport and the borders were not taken seriously because it was not incorporated in the previous FY. On the success of rebuilding the collapsed fish stock, the Portfolio Committee may need be informed whether the stock were recoverable enough to accommodate the small scale fishers or how the stocks were performing so that when the small scale fishery policies were to be implemented it would balance with what the Department&nbsp; and fishers said. Fishing right allocation process was successfully concluded which could be questionable because the review process was completed and if there were people who had appealed, that would be written off. Once it had been done, then it could be considered as concluded. . In the report of the Department and MLRF there were some inconsistencies, for example sea base inspection. In the report of the Department, its target was 600 while it achieved 679 (overachievement) whereas as in MLRF report it was reported as 497 &ndash; this could be a reflection of inconsistency.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe issue of confiscation of illegally harvested fishery resources could be an achievement, but is also a reflection that the law enforcement was not working because the ultimate goal was to stop people from fishing illegally instead of arresting them; the implementation of the fishery security strategy which encompasses the whole security from harvesting illegally. Aquaculture is doing exceptionally well with realistic planning. The Department may need to inform the Committee on the need to expand fisheries into new fisheries. The Department should report on In-land fisheries policy and steps taken to address it. Some figures like the financial expenditure from the department and MLRF were inconsistent. The Department had been struggling to use the money allocated to it hence its under expenditure keeps increasing. The fruitless and wasteful expenditure seemed to be uncontrollable due to some of the regulations considered. The Committee may enquire on wasteful expenditure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong><em>Discussion</em></strong><br />\r\n\tMr B Joseph (EFF) commented that there was a difference in the actual targets set in the annual performance plans and strategic plans at the end of the term; he asked if there was need for the Department to provide evidence to enable the Committee report correctly on issues.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson commented that treasury annually reviewed the framework sent to the Department including the report format. In some instances when the Department migrates into a format, they do not inform Parliament hence the communication gap. The interaction was becoming difficult between the Department and Parliament to monitor the actual performance on a quarterly basis. How can the Portfolio Committee make the Department understand that reliable information was critical in order for the Committee to be able to assist the Department in oversight? If there were changes in formats, the Department had the responsibility to brief the Portfolio Committee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Qwabe explained that for each target set out in the Annual Performance Plan of the Department, there would be extended explanation on the target, action plans, performance measurement of each target and evidence to backup target achievement. If there were changes to the strategic plan there should be a reviewed strategic plan tabled to inform the Portfolio Committee about the changes and the reasons for the changes would be stated. On a quarterly target it&rsquo;s difficult to see changes on quarterly basis same with expenditure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Joseph requested clarity on how quarterly targets that were carried over into the next quarter were reported as the previous quarter delivery.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Qwabe replied that the researchers only reviewed the information reported by the Department and that thirty days after a quarter had been concluded, the Department could make available the report of what it had achieved, the Department could also engage the Committee on how far it had gone with the Q3 and Q4. It was increasingly difficult for the Department to pick up momentum to reach the annual targets; by the Q4 targets not met in previous quarters should have been concluded.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>DAFF on its 2014/15 First Quarter Performance and Expenditure Report</strong><br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson welcomed the Director General of the Department and her team to the meeting on the Annual reports of DAFF and its entities. The focus would be on DAFF, Ncera farms, NAMC, PPECB and NAMC. The meeting would be on the first quarter report and the achievements of the department and its entities. The Committee had met with the AGSA on the overview of the department&rsquo;s performance and also met with DPME. Apologies were read from Ms T Gasebonwe-Tongwane(ANC),Mr P Mabe(ANC),Mr Z Mandela(ANC),Mr T&nbsp; Ramkohoase (ANC) and Mr M Hlengwa(IFP).She asked after the Minister and the Deputy Minister.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs A Steyn (DA) expressed dissatisfaction over the absence of the Minister and the Deputy Minister as it was important that they were both present at annual report discussions in order to take responsibility for the Department.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Edith Vries, Director General: DAFF explained that the World Food Day was being held same day at Limpopo - an event where the agricultural sector met globally to draw attention to Food security and reflect on how far the sector had gone and then make new commitments for the following year. The Minister and Deputy Minister were at the World Food Day function in Limpopo and tabled an apology on behalf of the Minister and Deputy Minister. As the Accounting Officer , she was delegated to present the Annual report and assured the Committee that all questions would be well answered. She<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson commented that the Minster had asked for a change of date when he got the invitation from the Committee as the date clashed with the World Food day held on the 16<sup>th</sup> of October. It had been communicated that it was impossible to shift the date due to Parliament programme as the Committee had two weeks to submit its report to the Parliament. However, it was expected that e the Deputy Minister would be present at the annual report meeting while the Minister attended the event.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr C Maxegwana (ANC) accepted the apology of the Minister and added that the Minister should have communicated days before the event about his programme to attend the event in order for the Committee to put such into consideration. Going forward, the Department had the responsibility of informing the Committee on events and should therefore communicate days ahead.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr M Filtane(UDM) commented that the reason for the absence of both the Minister and Deputy Minister was quite plausible but it was not understood why they would prioritize an International event over a critical matter of annual report. Consequently, the Minister should be invited at another date to present the annual report of the Department while other reports of the entities be discussed at the current meeting.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Steyn commented that she knew about the World Food day but it was unfortunate that it clashed with the meeting and agreed that the Minister be invited another day to present the annual report of the Department while other reports be discussed at the current meeting.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Joseph commented that the reports of the entities were meant to flow from the annual report of the Department hence the Committee should entertain the annual report of the Department.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson commented that in terms of procedure, the Committee could not hear the annual reports of the entities before the annual report of the Department and e suggested that the first quarter report of the Department be considered while the annual report shifted to another day. Officials of Parliament should always assist the Committee by informing it about public event days that could not be altered in order to plan Parliament programme.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs E Masehela (ANC) commented that it would have been better if the Minister or his Deputy was present at the meeting. Considering the tight schedule of Parliament, it would be more difficult not to get the annual reports and the reports of the entities could not be discussed before the Department&rsquo;s report hence it was suggested that a message be relayed to the Minister that in future the Minster or his Deputy be present at annual report meeting if there was a clash in assignment. It was suggested that the annual report of the Department be discussed while questions that required the Minister&rsquo;s response are handled at a latter day.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Maxegwana commented that due to the timeline of Parliament and the deadline date (24<sup>th </sup>of October) for finalization of this process he suggested that the meeting should proceed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr S Mncwabe (NFP) commented that it was wrong for both the Minister and his Deputy to be absent. However considering the time frame given to the Portfolio Committee to finalize,the meeting should proceed, the Committee&rsquo;s displeasure must be communicated to the Minister and his deputy about their absence.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Filtane commented that the meeting should proceed as weekend was not an option for another meeting. It was hoped the team would convey the Committee&rsquo;s sentiment to the Ministry about their absence.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Steyn expressed her displeasure about the absence of the Minister and his deputy as she had a lot of questions for the Minister to answer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson said the meeting would have to proceed as majority had suggested however the Committee would write to the Minister to express its displeasure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Steyn commented that issues that could not be addressed by the DG should be sent to the Minister in writing and must be answered within ten days.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson concurred with Ms Steyn&rsquo;s proposal and declared the meeting open.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Vries promised to convey the message to the Minister. The Minister did not take the decision lightly as the year 2014 was declared the year of agriculture and food security.FAO and UNO also declared 2014 the International Family Farming year while the agricultural sector claimed October as the month of food security.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Vries briefed the Committee on the 2014/15 first quarter performance and expenditure report of DAFF. The period 1 April to 31 May was devoted to performance reviews an the verification of performance information which was submitted to the AG on 31 May 2014.The Department had 55 targets reporting its milestones for the Q1;no fraud and risk management report &nbsp;were recorded for Q1. 56% of the quarterly performance milestones were achieved. The department had set a target to reduce recurrent audit queries by 60%. Identified areas for improvement include- legislative review and the approval of key policy documents needed to be fast tracked; the following would be fast tracked in Q2: 14 pieces of legislation earmarked for finalization during the 2014/15 financial year-the target would not be achieved.4 pieces of legislations would be taken to cabinet in Q2.Policy document such as the Agricultural trade, competitiveness development strategy and agro processing policy and strategy would be taken to the cluster in Q2 as well.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Joshua Hlatshewago, CFO: DAFF continued the briefing with an expository on &nbsp;the expenditure trends of the Q1-2014/15.Per Programmes:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAdministration- budget was R 694 570 000 amount spent was R163 584 000&nbsp;&nbsp; 23.6%<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAgricultural Production Health- % Food safety: budget was R 2 199 796 000 amount spent was R 628 015 28.5%<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFood security and Agrarian Reform- budget was R1 711 095 amount spent was R350 587 000 20.5%<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTrade Promotion- budget was R294 223 000 amount spent was R102 307 000&nbsp;&nbsp; 34.8%<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tForestry and Natural Resources Management- budget was R1 364 923 amount spent was R102 307&nbsp;&nbsp; 34.8%<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFisheries- budget was R427 776 amount spent was R113 846 26.6%<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTotal budget was R6 692 383; total amount spent was R1 658 398 24.8% of budget spent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReasons for over/under spending against 25% target:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tProgramme 1: claims in respect of property management from D:PWD are awaited<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tProgrammes2: double payment to ARC, half yearly payment to OBP and Q1 payment for conditional grants to provinces for Ilima/letsemsa were made.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tProgramme 3: Payments to provinces in respect of CASP conditional grants were made at 20% of the appropriated amount.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tProgramme 4: once-off payment to Land and Agricultural bank of SA and NAMC.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tProgramme 5: payments to provinces in respect of Landcare conditional grants were made at 10% of the appropriated amount and CASP conditional grants were made at 20% of the appropriated amount.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tProgramme 6: Q1 payment to MLRF was made.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Discussion</em></strong><br />\r\n\tMs Steyn expressed concern over targets coming from previous years and asked how many of these targets were carried over from the previous years as there was no visible progress from rolling over unachieved targets into another quarter as some were never met in the last five years. It was concerning that targets on Bills were not met. On Programme 2 and animal disease prevalence, was there planning and were there personnel on ground. Was there any fence in place between South Africa and the borders? Was the plan on foot and mouth disease surveyed annually? Were there personnel to implement the drought and nutrition security plan (Fetsa Tlata)? No producers were linked to market during Q1 and &ndash; were there personnel to implement the plans on Agro processing and marketing? It was extremely concerning that SA might start to import timber- this would have an impact on the building industry, was there a DDG responsible for forestry?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Vries replied that considering the 2013/14 annual report and the Q1 report some targets were retained. Some targets would be retained as core to DAFF mandate such as support for small holder farmers (number of hectares that were planted), animal disease surveillance. Targets that were rolled over from the previous years were not accounted for in the annual report as only the targets in the annual report are accounted for. In quarterly reports, there are underperformances that are achieved at the end of the year. Some targets that were not achieved could be achieved at the end of the year while some may not be achieved. For instance on the protection of indigenous species; of the two species of livestock that were going to be protected through artificial insemination, the calves were not born by the end of 31<sup>st</sup> March hence such target could not be rushed. Plans developed five years ago could not just be taken and implemented yearly based on incidence and events, the plans and targets to be implemented had to be reviewed. Animal disease monitoring and surveillance was an area in the agric sector that the Department was proud of. Foot and Mouth disease was factored in 2011 due to the work done by DAFF officials, both National and Provincial; the Department was able to assure a global regulatory authority that it had been corrected. The fences along the borders were like cables but there were some red zone areas; areas of biosecurity risks that were fenced. There was a difference between food and nutrition security policy plans and Fetsa tlatla. Fetsa Tlatla was one of the food production responses to food security. Food security policy was implemented and approved last year. There should be a food security plan that would address APAP. Food security plans should be measurable. Food security was not only the responsibility of agric department but other departments too hence should be set as a target There were category A and B forests that were commercial forests which were responsible for most of the pulps used in wood and paper industry. DAFF was responsible for category B&amp;C forests which were not necessarily commercial forests rather land, forests and space land and hoped to get to a point where NDP would set a target for new forests to be planted and reforestation. Forestry made up about 19% of DAFF budget and there was no risk that the country would have to import timber.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Filtane remarked that he was shocked when DG said the Department could not link producers to the market which was a long standing problem in the agric sector. What were the fundamental problems with the Department facilitating access to market because private producers had access to the market? How did the Department hold people accountable when they did not perform as expected were they issued letters of warning or was a disciplinary process was put in place? &nbsp;The core function of DAFF was to meet demands/needs hence if meeting this target was a recurring problem one would ask if the Department was functioning in terms of food security and agrarian reform. How could the Committee help with this recurring problem? How were managers who did not deliver on what they were expected to do dealt with The Department should initiate a piece of legislation to enhance the actualization of certain targets. What<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Vries responded that none of the legislations put forward was new; there were 24 existing pieces of legislations that were reviewed last year. Some of the old legislations had to be reviewed because the legislations had to be brought in line with the Constitution. Further, refinement needed to be done to bring them in line with the NDP. Legislation and regulations was the framework of the Department. The Department had no jurisdiction to scrap legislations but could only make sure that it followed the channel, reviewed by the Parliamentarians and promulgated by the President. The previous Minister decided not to drive the Legislation programs toward the end of the term. The target had been set in the APP tabled in February- In the Q1 of the year, Cabinet was not going to review new Legislation and the new Minister was not expected to drive the target when he newly came into Office from week one. The Department began to drive legislation when the new administration began to understand the portfolio. Therefore as indicated, the Department may not be able to finish the 24 legislations targeted but hoped to do so. For the next three quarters, the reports would be to meet the 14 pieces of legislation and have them approved. Feed and fertilizer Act of 1957 needed to be reviewed as it was clumsy and involved areas outside the agric sector. The target to link producers with the market was unrealistic and more thoughts had to be given to the set targets hence huge improvement in the APP in terms of target settings. Some targets were not SMART and could not be achieved in three months but would be achieved in the annual report. The target of reducing 60% of audit query was set by the Department itself as it could not continue with the same audit findings. If there was non-compliance with performance agreement and other areas, disciplinary actions would be taken. Most disciplinary hearings in the last quarter had resulted in dismissals.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Joseph commented that from all indications, the Department had failed to meet the annual targets in terms of the APP in the office of the DG. The milestone for Q1 was 3 only 1 was completed which pertained to the update of annual planning of strategic plan. The Department should have met the target of fraud and risk management; why was it not achieved and who was meant to assist the DG in risk management? Why was a Committee not set up for Fraud and Corruption plan? The Human Resource plan was not achieved due to extension for late submission of plan requested from the DPSA and reasons should be provided for non achievement as there was a request for late submission till 31<sup>st</sup> July. Which of the performance indications of targets were met on stakeholder relationship and Communication plan? The first quarter targets were unachieved; a lot of things administratively were not achieved by the Department. Intergovernmental strategy was approved and implemented but not achieved at Q1; it should be adjusted t to assist the Department. Implementing and developing the strategic plan and APP in such a way that it was possible in terms of the Department project management circle to deliver on these issues especially at the beginning of a financial year was critical. The Department should not overload itself with the administrative processes in order to comply in terms of targets &nbsp;in its APP.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Vries replied that there was a strategic risk register in place- however the office of the DG did not have any staff who managed risk as the former staff responsible for this function was non-performing and incompetent. The only person who could perform this task was the DG herself, but time constraints were a factor. There was a fraud prevention plan/strategy and a fraud committee had been set up; the fraud prevention plan would be made part of the mandate of the Risk Committee which had to be corrected. DAFF had been given space by the Presidency to do adjustments to its APP to ensure alignment between its APP and the MTFS approved by the Cabinet by the beginning of June. If there were changes to be made to the HR plan, it would be done.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Maxegwana commented that in the manifesto and National Development Plan, focus was to develop small holder producers. Food gardens and small holder producers must be encouraged in order to contribute to the objective of food security. DAFF was given a task to perform as it was important that small holder producers graduated to become big. What support could be given to the small holder producers to be part of the market and to realize the goal of food security? Eastern Cape was known for livestock production hence it was important to focus on the province. There was need to assist the people in ensuring that there was health in the livestock in order to keep excelling in animal production. What measures were in place to ensure that Eastern Cape did not fall off in livestock production as a province?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Edith responded that food security was not only developing small holders but also about increasing the capacity to deliver food in the country to people who were most vulnerable for example the three priorities of the Minister were to increase food security, numbers of job and contribution of agric to GDP. Part of the Minister&rsquo;s progamme was around food security. Limpopo province had done successful clustering where producers producing similar commodity would work together. The CASP programme was evaluated and about 80% of the producers had a market for their products. Eight veterinary mobile clinics were deployed to the Eastern Cape out of the twenty three pilot mobile veterinary clinics put in the system. DAFF had to make sure that farmers were serviced in order to ensure the health of the herds; the next set of vehicles would strengthen the norms and standards.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Masehela commented that the Department needed to be helped with its overall performance of 48% which was below the 50% average. Small holder producers should be aggressively assisted in order to address poverty. What services could be put in place to assist small producers maximise production? The fraud prevention policy and plan which had not yet commenced was concerning and should be addressed immediately.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Vries agreed that DAFF performance had to be upgraded; DAFF stood by its commitments in this regard. In the past the Department agreed with provinces on CASP, provinces did the implementation, when planning was done with provinces certain guidelines were set, provinces gave DAFF the business plans based on given guidelines and DAFF provided the resources. APAP and ARC information helped with land capability, DAFF gave farmer&rsquo;s money to plant a particular commodity in an area.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Z Jongbloed (DA) expressed concerns over the fishery sector as low targets were set. On the strategic objectives on monetary control and surveillance; targets for land and board inspection was 12, a total of 20 board inspections were conducted; the targets were overachieved.&nbsp; More than 12,000 export permit were issued whereas only 20 inspections were conducted. Numbers did not tally because on paper targets looked good. How were targets determined?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Mortimer Mannya, DDG, FM: DAFF replied that before targets were set, risks would be considered and matched with the desired mitigation measures and resources available. Five areas of risk management included sea, landing, port of entry, processing entities and right holders. Combinations were done to set targets for each one of them. All the ports of entries were considered, the levels of activities were reviewed and targets were set for those areas- for example 10% of right holders were investigated for compliance.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson remarked on the issue of mitigation in terms of greenhouses in the annual report as the agric sector would be more affected by climate change than any other department hence DAFF needed to come up with action plan on climate change. On the management of performance of DAFF officials; there was a poor response to the fire outbreak that occurred in Free State. There was a need to address the issue of planning and implementation; monitoring, evaluation and alignment of planning. HODs of provinces would be called to account for their conditional grants and business plans. The Committee should be informed about changes in polices by the Department, for instance the Fetsa Tlata policy was to plant 1 million hectares of land by 2019 which was changed to 1 million jobs to be created by 2019.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Vries responded that there was no specific target that dealt with mitigation of greenhouse gas emission but planting the correct indigenous trees by increasing aforestation and deforestation would help with climate change. The officials that were negligent at the fire outbreak had been dealt with. The national department was not responsible for fire management- it was the responsibility of the province to provide a disaster management plan. A target of 250 000 hectares was set last year, this year a target of 400 000 hectares was set but no new money came in hence it had to allocate from CASP money to meet Fetsa tlatla target. Provinces received equitable share to do their work while some province relied on CASP money. The target of 1 million hectare was for the sector included social development and rural development.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Filtane stated that the Department needed to go back to improve on its report on basic management skills. The Department at the national level had the responsibility of food security and poverty alleviation. There was need to write to the Minister for the statistic of civil servants who were under performing. The issue of fertilizer was in the public domain which was a national problem that had to be resolved by the national department. There should be a solution to the monopoly of fertilizer production. The President in his SoNA referred to a radical change; figures of civil servants who were not performing were required.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Steyn commented that SA had the highest cases of fire outbreak this year. Few people and animals died in the Free State fire outbreak; the role of the national department should go beyond monitoring at this crisis stage. There was a disagreement between the local government and the province on who would assist the victims.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson commented that the Department had taken cognizance of the issues raised. There was Intergovernmental Relation framework Act such that if the municipality did not respond then the other sphere should respond There was &nbsp;need for a radical change, however the improvements made were appreciated. Issues raised should be implemented; the Committee would be going to monitor Fetsa Tlatla in November.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>DAFF on its 2013/14 Annual Report</strong><br />\r\n\tMs Vries briefed the Committee on the performance highlights of DAFF over the 2013/14 financial year. Key highlights included- There was accelerated production to enhance food security: The National policy on food and Nutrition was approved by Cabinet in September 2013 and the Fetsa Tlatla food production initiative was launched to enhance food production at national and household level. On general household survey (2013), the number of persons who faced difficulties in accessing food in 2013 increased to 13.8 million persons as against 13.6 million persons in 2012. The Department targeted support to producers in order to facilitate greater inclusivity through CASP and Illima/Letsema. On access to markets, the Department mobilized and supported smallholder producers to increase production and access export market opportunities through World food programme;88 smallholders produced sufficiently high quality maize. On bio security success, South Africa is now foot and mouth disease free. Conditional Extension Recovery Plan (ERP) was set in place to strengthen and improve extension and advisory support services in SA. A total of R339 927 million was budgeted over the year under review. The extension &ndash;farmer ratio had also improved form 1:1200 in 2007 to 1:878 at the end of the year under review. The norms and standards recommend a ratio of 1:250-500 depending on the commodity. Conditional Grants: Land Care: a total of R108 997 million was allocated and an amount of R105 823 million was transferred to provinces. The actual project expenditure of Landcare amounted to R102 008 million which was 96% of transferred funds to provinces. MAFISA was set up to provide funding through provisionally accredited DFIs to on-lend to targeted HDI agricultural micro businesses covering irrigation, livestock, equipment and production inputs. DAFF introduced an external bursary scheme in 2004 along side with the career awareness programme as a measure of recruiting young people at an early age to follow a career in one of the identified scarce and critical skills in agric, forestry and fisheries. In the financial year 2013/14, 35 interns who participated in the young professional development programme were employed. 57% of bursaries awarded went to females and 43% to male. On complexities as per intergovernmental coordination, DAFF receives funding from the national fiscus and allocates conditional grant funding to provinces in accordance with the Division of Revenue Act. DAFF had a national policy responsibility to develop and promote inland/fresh water aquaculture as an economic activity contributing towards food production and security. The presentation further highlighted the performance summary of the Department per programmed in the year under review &ndash; in total, 79% of its total targets were achieved and a total of 9 932 jobs created in 2013/14 (see document).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn its 2013/14 Audit Report and the AG&rsquo;s findings, the Department had an unqualified audit opinion for 2013/14 in respect of the financial information The AG drew attention to the following matters: Predetermined objectives(performance information, strategic planning and management);Audit outcome not in place; Ineffective internal audit; procurement and contract management; insufficient oversight on reporting; insufficient HR; risk assessment not conducted; risk management strategy not in place.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Joshua&nbsp; Hlatshwego, CFO: DAFF briefed the Committee further on the state of expenditure as at March 2014. A total of R6 111 313 was spent as at the end of March out of a budget of R6 182 282 making a total of 98.9%. 99.4% was spent on Compensation of employees; 99.7% on transfers and subsidies; payment for capital assets 96.8%. The 2014-19 Focus of the Department was- 1. Food security: to ensure that 12million citizens who were vulnerable to hunger and food insecure had sufficient access to safe and nutritious food. 2. Transform the sector: promote and empower small holder producers through targeted support measured to increase their competitiveness edge towards becoming sustainable producers. 3. Create jobs: achieve the NDP goal of creating 1 million new jobs by 2030. 4. Increase the contribution of Agriculture to GDP: implement APAP; strengthen animal disease and plant pest control capabilities and surveillance measures to enhance exports and trade. 5. Conclude trade opportunities with other emerging economies and accelerate trade on African continent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Portfolio Committee recommends the tabling of the 2013/14 annual report of DAFF.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong><em>Discussion</em></strong><br />\r\n\tMr Maxegwana commended the Department on its unqualified audit; a clean audit would have been better than the unqualified audit. &nbsp;Managing resources was good but the impact was more important. There was an alignment in DAFF plan with the NDP which was an achievement. The conditional grant and how they were utilized was a source of concern. The Fetsa tlatla pet project needed to be understood; what was being done on the 1m hectare target to be achieved. The Department should act like one from the local to national level.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Vries appreciated the comment on the improvement and retaining the unqualified audit report for the last five years and remarked that a clean audit was the Department&rsquo;s aspiration. There was CASP report which confirmed that the evaluation report done by the University of Pretoria did not have a good impact as it should have therefore there should be improvement. DAFF had tightened the planning with provinces and monitoring of provinces.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Masehela commended the Department on its report. The department was not doing well on the issue of equity in terms of women and people living with disabilities. Did the department have systems to check whether transfers to provinces were used for the right purposes and if such money was monitored to see if they were used fruitfully? What was the Department doing to assist farmers to make sure that crops were not destroyed due to invader food flies in the Northern Cape and Limpopo? Fetsa Tlatla was a good project in the rural areas where people had land - what role was played by the extension officers in order to reach the 1m hectare target.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Mannya replied that the food fly invasion formed part of the surveillance that the Department controlled and there were control measures available over the last few years. The emphasis on part of national livestock program was on the recording because it linked to genetic information system. If the farmers had the history of keeping information, they would be able to monitor the performance of the animals. It was intended to monitor the performance linked to the research problems of ARC.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Vries added that the job descriptions of directorates had been increased to include monitoring. DAFF had 42% women in senior management there was an improvement compared to the past; Female candidates were preferred in senior management vacancies. There was plan for monitoring provinces report. DAFF had an extension recovery plan as tablet system was introduced where extension officers were able to demonstrate what had been done. There was a system that intended to put in place agric information management system which could take a few years to process.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Steyn remarked that the number of hungry people in SA should be measured and considered as the basic thing the department was responsible for. It was concerning concern that hunger in SA was going up and this should be analyzed with massive support towards social grants and other programmes; the programme should be analyzed. According to the AG on the outcomes of the portfolio, the quality of submitted reports regressed since the previous year. For DAFF and entities, the most common root causes was slow response by management; For DAFF the root cause was lack of consequences for poor performance and transgression. The Minister should respond in writing how to fix these root causes. On the challenges with the utilization of transferred land and development of small holders; the fact that land reform was failing was the fault of DAFF - for not having plans in place. On the subdivision of agricultural land and the link between the municipalities, an Act that was reviewed in Sept 1998 but not proclaimed; it was this to be revisited? It was concerning that DAFF cancelled the planned agricultural census; if you cannot measure you cannot manage. Amount spent on consultants used to review legislation especially when there were legal team that could have reviewed same at the Department was worrisome. Also concerning was that 98% of the budget was spent with low targets achieved. The outcome of investigations ordinarily determines the disciplinary process by the accounting officer What was the Department doing to ensure the economic growth of the sector as the sector was not performing as it was supposed to- there was a need to come up with a proposal and a plan. On the registration certificates, it had become a source of concern that people were putting stuffs in the market illegally thereby putting the industry at risk; what was the Minister was doing to fix this? On the complaints mechanism of the Department, many letters were sent to the Minister and DG without response; what mechanisms were in place to address this? &nbsp;There were massive problems in the fishing industry hence the need for policy development and legislative changes. A report on the status of Fetsa Tlatala and its impact was requested. What was the role of the Department in ensuring that OBP functioned properly in agric production health and food safety? What impact could vaccines unavailability have? &nbsp;A full report on all aquaculture programmes in SA and the amount of money put into it was requested. On agro processing, it was suggested that there should be discussion with DTI and the private sector.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Vries in response stated that the current administration desired to be known to make a difference to hunger in SA. Seminars would be done on food security, accessibility and affordability of food. The feedback from the AG acknowledged an improvement hence DAFF could not respond to the quality of regressed report raised. Managers were required to be in audit committee meetings in order to address the slow response of management. Land reform and agric department were working together; rural development was excited about APAP because it was the instrument that would bring about the revitalization of agric and grow the GDP and become the anchor around which the government was to hang land reform development. Research would be done about the subdivision of the Agric Reform Act which not been repealed. There was a plan for agric census to be reopened as pilot cost of about R60 million had been set aside. There were certain works that consultants were required to do. DAFF would like to present APAP to the Portfolio Committee on what it was doing to grow the sector. The Department had different improvement programmes; its mandate was not developing infrastructure. DAFF provides technical assessment plans but not implementation. DTI looked at the industry for agro processing as part of the revitalization of agric was to stop exporting many materials in raw form. The commodity group had worked with DAFF on APAP, CEO forum and Operation Pakista.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Hlatshewajo added that DAFF was creating an enabling environment for developing policy framework for aquaculture. In working towards developing an aquaculture funding programme, some regulatory problems were encountered with respect to authorization with the Department of Environment. Operation Pakista was intended to accelerate the development of aquaculture.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Mncwabe commended the initiative on youth development programme and asked for the breakdown of bursary funds to schools. Awareness was not wide spread, particularly in township as in rural areas on the high school bursary scheme. These programmes should be marketed well in rural areas as well as urban areas. Were the programmes nationally found in all provinces or selected universities? The feasibility of the programmes in schools was questionable.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Edith Vries replied that Members would be provided with copies of the document to popularize the bursary schemes. Some agric colleges were reestablished for accreditation by the Council of Higher Education.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Joseph expressed concern about evictions on farms in the Eastern Cape and how people had been threatened; animals shot in front of workers on farms. Other questions would be put in writing to the Minister.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr L Ntshayisa (AIC) asked for the criteria used by the Department to provide support to farmers and the procedure followed by farmers to access this support. for a &nbsp;reconciliation of the 98% budget spent against the 79% target achieved was requested- &nbsp;was it was due to lack of capacity or shortage of staff? &nbsp;There was no policy or legislation on In-land fishing and this should be addressed urgently.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Vries replied that criteria varied with provinces.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Hlatshwajo added that R1.5 billion of DAFF budget went to compensation of employment; 60% went to departmental entities. There were targets within some entities that were not in the Department.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Filtane asked what the Department meant by sufficient high quality maize. Did the R55 million spent on revitalization of agricultural colleges address the challenges in the college and did the internship programme have any impact on the Department? &nbsp;Were transfers also made to municipalities? There was an ongoing debate that agriculture was not a constituency of a municipality of local government&ndash; what was the structure of funding for small holder farmers. Information from the department was not reliable according to the AGs opinion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Vries replied that the world food programme required that 30% of the maize be bought from small holders. World food programmme found the maize from small holder suitable which provided access to market. DAFF does not transfer to municipalities but had put in place in the last six months a provincial planning forum in each province by the HOD for rural development and agric.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Hlatshwajo added that R55 million used for revitalization went to infrastructure. There had been improvement from DAFF in terms of audit queries for the last few years. DAFF kept improving information on its audit matrix and held each DDG accountable on how to clear the audit finding.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson remarked that the quality assurance of the Department was questionable and Parliament should be respected by providing thorough report. Had the critical positions in the Department been filled? The structure should be reviewed to respond to the mandate and needs of the Department as there were a lot of duplications among the entities. The President had set up a commission to review the entities of government what were the recommendations and how did they would impact on agric? How did the department intended to implement the recommendations if adopted by the Cabinet? On the R23 million spent on training, what the type of training was done? &nbsp;The pace of the consolidation of the conditional grants which was yet to be implemented as reported by FFC was concerning. How much was spent on contract workers versus permanent staff? The R10.2 million used for consultants and R1.5 million for one consultant in reviewing of legislation needed to be addressed. &nbsp;Further details were requested on the empowerment funds and the number of farmers assisted- were the farmers indebted to the Department?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Vries commented that DAFF had nine DDGs, five positions filled with four vacant. Integration of conditional grants must be negotiated and approved by national treasury.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Hlatshwajo added that DAFF appointed nine intermediaries to run loans on its behalf; the Department was not happy about some intermediaries in terms of performance and reporting hence it had three intermediaries left. The three intermediaries helped with loan recovery rate up to 70%- this amounted to R10.2 million spent on consultants for legislation review.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Ncera Farms on its 2013/14 Annual Report</strong><br />\r\n\tMr Mzi Titimani, CEO: Ncera Farms briefed the Committee on the performance overview of Ncera In the 2013/14 financial year. Under Mechanism, 8 tractors and 7 bakkies services/repaired/maintained, ploughing equipment to be repaired,1 truck to be repaired&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : 6 tractors and 5 bakkies were service/repaired/mainytained;4 ploughs and disc harrow were repaired;1 truck was repaired.On Crop section, Purchasing of packing materials, fertilizer and selling of vegetables to the market was achieved. Five villages were assisted with mechanization services. Medicines, doses and feed for the livestock were purchased. All animals are dosed and dipped to control internal and external parasites.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Khaghaz Guezda, CFO: Ncera Farms, briefed the Committee on the financial report for 2013/14.The entity maintained the record of the unqualified audit report. No irregular or wasteful expenditure was incurred by the entity in 2013/14 financial year. Most of the budget allocation was spent on compensation of employees, other administrative expenses and little for programmes. Findings of the AG include no board directors, no audit committee and internal auditors.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA budgetary allocation of R 5 020 000 was approved for 2013/14 for which actual expenditure was R4 994 208 and a variance of R25 792 was recorded. Further details on the expenditure pattern per programme were highlighted in the presentation (see document).</p>\r\n<p>Challenges faced by Ncera Farms include lack of funding, no board directors, township establishment (Pilvering possibilities). In conclusion, the little budget Ncrea had was able to produce healthy Nguni cattle, assisted five villages with contract ploughing, assisted communities with good quality goats. A decision has been taken by DAFF to transfer Ncera to ARC.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong><em>Discussion</em></strong><br />\r\n\tMr Ntyshayisa pleaded that the Department fast tracked the transfer process in order for the workers on Ncera farm not to lose focus.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Filtane asked if there were external methods for ensuring quality control or quality management for livestock marketability. DAFF should consider the possibility of accelerating the transfer process in order to counter the negative psychological state suffered by the worker on the suspension of the transfer.<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson noted that ARC would be present at the next meeting to give an update on the status of the transfer of Ncera to ARC.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Vries commented that ARC could not do deregistration hence the Minister of Finance had been written for deregistration. The Minister had asked that communication be established with the staff of Ncera farms.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Marine Living Resources Fund (MLRF) on its 2013/14 Annual Report</strong><br />\r\n\tMr Mortimer Mannya,DDG, FM: DAFF briefed Committee on the &nbsp;2013/14 annual report of MLRF. The presentation covered the strategic overview, governance overview and policy environment of the MLRF(see document). Achievements recorded for the 2013/14 were- the MLRF obtained an unqualified audit report both on financial and performance information. 20 farms were given technical support to access development funding to the tune of R87 million which led to the attraction of private investment worth R384 million into the aquaculture sector. MLRF completed the aquaculture sector performance study and published the South African Aquaculture Yearbook. National aquaculture policy framework and review of all pieces of domestic legislation governing aquaculture was undertaken and completed-24 pieces of legislation which affected and controlled aquaculture were reviewed. The second long term right allocation process was undertaken on eight sectors. The Fishing rights allocation program 2013(FRAP 2013) was concluded albeit objections. Fisheries protection vessels had been at sea to ensure surveillance and protection; multiple inspections were conducted on vessels at landing sites due to the 100 jobs which were created through working for fisheries program (WFFP) in the commercial monitoring project to monitor commercial landing. Joint operations were conducted and led to confiscations, arrests and successful prosecution; Increased law enforcement efforts within four key fisheries sector; hake, abalone, west coast lobster and traditional line fish.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChallenges faced by MLRF include- the historical legacy of an untransformed sector, illegal practices, limited capacity impact on these FRAP processes, large research vessel Africana had not been back at sea as its aging and would require replacement; Research capacity was limited by the number of experts and was not adequate for numbers of fish species to be investigated including the new species. New species under investigation had not yet yielded results of economic viability; the integration of sea based operations was not adequate; prosecution capacity was still limited and required more enhancement in collaboration with the relevant departments. Poaching rate had not dropped to desired levels.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPlanned key focus areas for the periods 2014- 19 include: the development of the aquaculture s a growth sector under Phakisa; implementation of an integrated fisheries security plan as part of Phakisa Marine protection, the revitalization and strengthening fishing harbors operational management; finalization of the regulations and implementation of the small scale fishing policy etc.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt was recommended that the Portfolio Committee recommends the tabling of the 2013/14 report of MRLF.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>National Agricultural Marketing Council (NAMC) on its 2013/14 Annual Report</strong><br />\r\n\tMr Andre Young, Chairman: NAMC briefed the Committee on the 2013/14 annual report of NAMC. The briefing discussed the mission as well as the legislative mandate and strategic objectives of NAMC (see document).</p>\r\n<p>Mr Tshihilo Ramabulana, CEO: NAMC continued the briefing with an overview on the divisions of NAMC which were statutory measures; agri-trusts; market and economic research centre; agribusiness development and administration. 86%of targets were achieved on statutory measure investigations out of a target of 36, &nbsp;31 were met. 54% of targets were achieved on statutory measures gazette out of a target of 24, 13 were met. On levies collected per commodity- Citrus (exported) amounted to R42 216 161;Lucerne 981934; Wine R6 1748 389. Functions financed through statutory levies in 2013/14: on transformation R 83 695 832 was spent; 22.5% of total levy expenditure. On research R61 262 679 was spent; 16.47% % of total levy expenditure. Activities regarded as transformation include production material/inputs, extension services, mentorship, bursaries, and salaries for black transformation managers etc. For Strategic Integrated Projects (SIP 11): the business plan was completed, it focused on 26 high impact agricultural infrastructures project and 600 smaller projects funded by CASP,IDC, 10 high impact projects had commenced.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Sarah Muyhulawa, CFO: NAMC briefed the Committee on the finance and administration of NAMC. Sponsorship received was R26, 6 million, expenditure totaled R59.9 million, there was no unauthorized expenditure recorded. External audit report of the NAMC was unqualified. A 14% increase in personnel expenditure as a result of increase in the amount paid toward performance bonuses and the annual salary adjustments of 7% was recorded. There was a decrease of 22% on operating expenditure due to the decrease in the number of section 7 and workgroup investigations. There was an increase of 389% in professional services as a result of an increase in expenditure for sponsored projects. There was also an increase of 28% as a result of increase in expenditure for travel sand accommodation related to the sponsorship projects.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong><em>Discussion</em></strong><br />\r\n\tMr Filtane was impressed by the services of NAMC and asked if it gave provided to farmers in the Eastern Cape.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Ramabulana replied that NAMC worked in the Eastern Cape as the majority of NAMC work was done through community organizations and associations. It worked in different parts of the Eastern Cape.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Jongbloead asked how small scale farmers fit into NAMC objectives and if there were any indication of when other Provinces would be rolled out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Ramabulana responded that one of the first objectives in the NAMC Act was increasing market access for all market participants. NAMC needs to work towards opening markets; protecting small players who were disadvantaged against market influences that could kick them out. The first phase of rolling out aims to other provinces was to try to understand what each province and SOE had in terms of information system.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Steyn advised that NAMC should try to work on a plan regarding fluctuation of prices of certain commodities as it was sometimes difficult for farmers to determine input costs at the beginning of a season. What type of guidelines could be given so that there could be subsidy or assistance?&nbsp; Some of the levies had not been renewed &ndash; they should be renewed annually. When would the renewal happen and what was the impact on specific commodities if not renewed? , Had the impact study on the industry been done and what percentage of transformation happened through the levies? NAMC&rsquo;s report was requested for the Committee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Ramabulana agreed that there were certain commodities that became less viable. There was some level of transparency in terms of market functions in order for farmers to take the right decisions on if and what to plant.&nbsp; There was impact of levy renewal; NAMC was engaging with traders and importers to address the problem of gazetting new measures. NAMC reviewed what had been done on an annual basis and provided the report to the Ministry on that. Every third year NAMC carried out independent work to review the impact of transformation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The report had been sent to the Committee but NAMC would ensure that each Committee Member received it.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson congratulated NAMC for the clean audit but noted with concern that there was a regression and advised the entity to do more on compliance. Could NAMC research potential markets in government and gives guidelines to government?<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Perishable Export Council Control Board (PPECB) on its 2013/14 Annual Report</strong><br />\r\n\tMr Angelo Peterson, Chairman: PPECB briefed the Committee on the entity&rsquo;s 2013/14 annual report. The briefing highlighted the vision and mission of PPECB as well as its strategic objectives. A new board was established in October 2014.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Johan Scwiebus, CFO: PPECB briefed the Committee on the financial performance of PPECB for 2013/14. Amount budgeted for expenses for 2013/14 was R212 969; actual amount spent was R226 067 leaving a deficit of 6.2%. An analysis of expenses was as follows- 14% of total cost was spent on activities (subsidies and travel), actual cost of R48 million different from of the budgeted cost of R46 million. Important indicators highlighted: the entity had reserves of R92.5 million and cash investments of R79.5 million; Debtor&rsquo;s Collection was achieved in40days against a target of 55days and Fruitless and wasteful expenditure stood at R518 455 000. 69% of the budget was spent on employees; 15% spent on activities;8% on administration;4% on computers;3% on rental;2% on training;2% on depreciation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Stuart Symington, CEO: PPECB briefed the Committee on its operations.173 970 containers were inspected,11% were rejected due to -22% false codling moth,3% decay,36% blemishes,372% citrus black spot and 74% injuries.53 020 export certificates were processed. PPECB had revolutionized its business with tablet technology that provided real time information; created a collaborative supply chain; a paperless environment; complying with regulation, maximized efficiencies, leverage Gen-Y skills and worked from anywhere. The Organizational performance of PPECB was measured by 62 performance indicators; 84% were fully achieved; 13% partially achieved and 3% of indicators not achieved. 152 Small farmers were trained in good agricultural practices; food safety; market access training; quality management training etc.</p>\r\n<p>Risk management identified lack of integrity of export certificates; insufficient IT infrastructure; inability to roll out technology; insufficient IT disaster recovery; outdated inspection methodology as challenges currently faced by the entity.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong><em>Discussion</em></strong><br />\r\n\tMs Steyn remarked that she was impressed by the export certificate as the EU had put some other measures in place. What was the cost on the black spot issue to the industry and would it be fixed before the next season. There was a massive increase in unshelled nut exports to China. It was a product that was usually stolen from trees which increased over the last three years. PPECB was arguably the best performing entity in the Department.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Symington in response acknowledged the team work of the entity and thanked the Committee. It was difficult to quantify losses. The export standard between DAFF and the industry was determined by unshelled nut at the moment as it was the fastest growing product for export.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Masehela remarked that areas like Limpopo had many produces like potatoes, tomatoes and fruits; why was it not possible to have processing in those areas in a bid to create jobs?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Symington replied that PPECB dealt with unprocessed products however the DTI could answer the question on processing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Filtane complemented PPECB on the great job done.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson welcomed PPECB&rsquo;s good performance and hoped it would do more and share its skills with other entities of the Department.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe meeting was adjourned.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "summary": "<p>The Committee was briefed by its support officials on the overview of the annual report of agriculture, forestry and fisheries for the 2013/14 financial year. The Department had a total of 37 targets and achieved on 25 of these. Various reasons were given for over performance or non-performance, including the involvement of other departments, provinces utilizing their equitable share, appropriate supporting documents as well as poor planning. The Department spent 98.8% of its appropriated budget in the 2013/14 financial year- over 77% of the Department&rsquo;s budget was spent between three programmes namely, Programme 2,Agricultural production, Health and Food safety(32.74%) and Programme 3,Food Security and Agrarian Reform(26.01%) and Programme 5,Forestry and Natural Resources Management(18.7%). The Department had no audit committee for the majority of the financial year under review. The Department indicated that its internal controls were adequate and effective. &nbsp;On the report of the AG, the Department received an unqualified audit opinion from the AG with a correction on the financial statements of prior period error(2012/13 year end) on the impairment of accrued departmental revenue due to agriculture debt account to the tune of R58 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe committee researcher briefed the Committee on the analysis of Marine Living Resources Fund and the Fisheries Management Branch. The inconsistencies in the ways targets were structured in the2013/14 strategic plan and the 2013/14 MLRF annual report was confusing. The inspections at the airport and borders were not taken seriously because they were not incorporated in previous financial year.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Committee expressed concern over the communication gap created between the Department and the Committee when targets are changed without informing the Parliament, which made it difficult to monitor target outcomes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries briefed the Committee on its 2014/15 first quarter performance and expenditure report. The period 1 April to 31 May was devoted to performance reviews and the verification of performance information which was submitted to the AG on 31 May 2014.The Department had 55 targets. &nbsp;Only 56% of the quarterly performance milestones were achieved. The Department had set a target to reduce recurrent audit queries by 60%. Areas for improvement included legislative review and the approval of key policy documents needed to be fast tracked. The total budget was R6 692 383; total amount spent was R1 658 398- only 24.8% of the budget was spent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Committee expressed concern about targets rolled over from previous years into the next financial year. Concern was raised about animal disease surveillance and planning on ground for the implementation- the Committee questioned if there were fences between the borders of South Africa and neighboring countries.&nbsp; The Committee requested clarity on measures taken to hold people accountable for non-performance. &nbsp;The Committee expressed concern on why the fraud and risk management target was not met by the Office of the DG.</p>\r\n<p>The Committee was briefed by the DAFF on its 2013/14 Annual report. The performance highlighted include- Accelerated production to enhance food security; The National policy on food and Nutrition was approved by Cabinet on September 2013 and the Fetsa Tlatla food production initiative was launched to enhance food production at national and household levels; Targeted support to producers in order to facilitate greater inclusivity through CASP and Illima/Letsema; Access to markets for smallholders; Mobilized and supported smallholder producers to increase production and access export market opportunities through World food programme; 88 smallholders produced sufficient high quality maize; farmer ratio had also improved form 1:1200 in 2007 to 1:878 at the end of the year under review. A total of R339 927 million was budgeted over the year under review. DAFF introduced an external bursary scheme in 2004 along side the career awareness programme as a measure to recruit young people at an early age to follow a career in one of the identified scarce and critical skills in agric, forestry and fisheries. In the financial year 2013/14, 35 interns who participated in the young professional development programme were employed. Bursaries were awarded to 57% females and 43% male. On its 2013/14 Audit Report, DAFF had an Unqualified audit opinion.</p>\r\n<p>The Committee remarked that an unqualified audit was commendable but a clean audit was better and it was more important to see the impact of those finances. The Committee expressed concern about conditional grants and how they were utilized. Members questioned the availability of systems to monitor the transfer of funds to provinces to ensure that they are used rightfully. The Committee questioned the role played by the extension officers in Fetsa tlata to ensure that the target of 1million hectare was met. The Committee expressed concern about the evictions on farms and how people were threatened- the criteria for giving support to farmers were requested as well as the impact of internship on the Department.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Committee was briefed by the Ncera Farms on its annual report for the 2013/14 financial year. The entity maintained the record of an unqualified audit report. No irregular or wasteful expenditure was incurred by the entity in the 2013/14 financial year. Findings of the AG included no board directors, no audit committee and internal auditors. Budget allocation was R 5 020 000; actual expenditure was R4 994 208: variance R25 792. Most of the budget allocation went to compensation of employees, other administrative expenses and a minimal part for programmes. &nbsp;The little budget Ncrea had was used to - produce healthy Nguni cattle, assist five villages with contract ploughing, assist communities with good quality goats. A decision was taken by DAFF to transfer Ncera to ARC.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Committee urged DAFF to fast track the transfer on Ncera to ARC in order to retain staff commitment. The Committee asked if there were external measures for ensuring quality control or management for livestock marketability.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe National Agricultural Marketing Council (NAMC) briefed the Committee on its 2013/14 annual report.<br />\r\n\tLevies collected per commodity for 2013/14 were as follows- Citrus (exported) a levy income of R42 216 161; Lucerne 981934; wine R6 1748 389. Expectations from bodies collecting levies include: fairness to all directly affected groups, responsiveness to industry challenges, and focus on long term strategic planning, good financial management etc. A profile of the expenditure categories as at 31 March 2014 was as follows- Personnel: an increase of 14% in personnel expenditure as a result of increase in the amount paid toward performance bonuses and the annual salary adjustments of 7%.Operating costs: a decrease of 22% on operating expenditure was due to the decrease in the number of section 7 and workgroup investigations. Research, workshop and investigation: an increase of 389% in professional services was as a result of an increase in expenditure for sponsored projects. Other administrative costs: an increase of 28% was as a result of increase in expenditure for travel sand accommodation related to the sponsorship projects.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Committee was impressed by the services of NAMC and the fact that NAMC provided services to farmers in Eastern Cape. The Committee asked how small farmers fit into NAMC objectives and when other provinces would be rolled out. The Committee expressed concern about the fluctuation of prices of commodities and the impact of levies that were not renewed on specific commodities.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPPECB briefed the Committee about its annual report for the 2013/14 financial year. A new board was established in October 2014. &nbsp;The financial performance of PPECB for 2013/14 financial year was as follows- Amount budgeted for expenses for 2013/14 was R212 969; actual amount spent was R226 067 leaving a deficit of 6.2%.Important indicators were also highlighted: PPECB had reserves to the tune of R92.5 million, while &nbsp;cash investments stood at R79.5 million. Debtor&rsquo;s Collection was achieved within 40days against a target of 55days. Fruitless and wasteful expenditure amounted to R518 455 000.<br />\r\n\tThe Organizational performance of PPECB was measured by 62 performance indicators; 84% of its targets were fully achieved; 13% partially achieved and 3% of indicators not achieved. Risk management identified lack of integrity of export certificates; insufficient IT infrastructure; inability to roll out technology; insufficient IT disaster recovery; outdated inspection methodology, were all contributory factors to non achievement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Committee was impressed by the export certificate and commended PPECB as the best performing entity under the Department. The Committee asked if it was possible to have processing in areas where raw produce were produced in order to create jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDAFF briefed the Committee on the annual report for the 2013/14 financial year of MLRF. Its achievements for 2013/14 include- obtained an unqualified audit report both on financial and performance information. 20 farms were given technical support to access development funding totally R87 million which led to the attraction of private investment worth R384 million into the aquaculture sector. The aquaculture sector performance study was completed and the South African aquaculture yearbook published. National aquaculture policy framework and review of all pieces of domestic legislation governing aquaculture was undertaken and completed. 24 pieces of legislation affected and controlled aquaculture. The second long term right allocation process was undertaken on eight sectors. The Fishing rights allocation program 2013(FRAP 2013) was concluded albeit objections. Fisheries protection vessels had been at sea to ensure surveillance and protection; multiple inspections were conducted on vessels at landing sites due to the 100 jobs which were created through working for fisheries program (WFFP) in the commercial monitoring project to monitor commercial landing. Joint operations are conducted and led to confiscations, arrests and successful prosecution; Increased law enforcement efforts within four key fisheries sector; hake, abalone, west coast lobster and traditional line fish. Challenges faced include: the historical legacy of an untransformed sector persists, illegal practices, limited capacity impact on FRAP processes. Large research vessel Africana had not been back at sea &nbsp;as it is aging and would require replacement; Research capacity was limited by the number of expert and was not adequate for numbers of fish species to be investigated including the new species. New species under investigation had not yet yielded results of economic viability; the number of sea days of the protection vessels had been limiting; the integration of sea based operations was not adequate; prosecution capacity was still limited and required more enhancement in collaboration with the relevant departments. Poaching rate had not dropped to desired levels.<br />\r\n\tIt was recommended that the Portfolio Committee recommends the tabling of the 2013/14 report of MRLF.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

However, it was now necessary to present the Annual Reports of the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) and its entities in depth, dealing with the specific audit outcomes and giving an explanation of what the audit report meant. She noted that she and her delegation would briefly recap the terminology for the Committee Members.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Fanie Kok, Senior Manager: AGSA briefed the Committee on the mandate of the AGSA to strengthen democracy by enabling oversight, accountability and governance in the public sector, through auditing, thereby building public confidence. The purpose of the presentation was to provide Members with the necessary information to enable the Committee to effectively execute its oversight function. He summarised that the financial statements were financially unqualified, in respect of the DAFF, the Marine Living Resources Fund (MLRF), National Agricultural Marketing Council (NAMC) and Onderstepoort Biological Products (OBP) but the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) required interventions. The performance reports of all five entities required intervention. The Supply chain management of DAFF, MLRF required intervention; ARC and NAMC was a concern; only OBP was good. The financial health of NAMC, ARC was good; MLRF, DAFF and OBP were of concern. Human resource management at OBP, MLRF and NAMC were good; DAFF and ARC were not. ICT at OBP required interventions, although DAFF was good, and there were concerns on this point in respect of ARC, NAMC and MLRF.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAGSA noted that the most common root causes were regressed slow responses by management, unchanged lack of competencies by key officials&rsquo; and regression on the lack of consequences for poor performance and transgressions. DAFF, ARC, OBP and MLRF had slow responses.&nbsp; DAFF and NAMC were both plagued by lack of competence in key officials. DAFF showed lack of consequence for poor performance and transgressions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Kok then highlighted the status of key commitments by Minister. Implementation had taken place in regard to aligning the performance agreements of senior management with the Department&#39;s strategic goals. Matters in progress included the strengthening of the monitoring and evaluation unit within the Department. Matters not implemented included the need to empower the internal audit function to be fully effective and functional; to manage deviation from the procurement process in a transparent manner; and to investigate ways to ensure that MLRF established its own board to enable better oversight responsibility.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew areas that still needed to be addressed were:<br />\r\n\t- the need to implement a plan to identify specific areas where service delivery would take place<br />\r\n\t- ensure linkage between the budget to the targets in the strategic plan<br />\r\n\t- implement checks and balances to ensure credibility and completeness of financial and performance reports<br />\r\n\t- make plans to support agricultural schools and encourage youngsters to study in the agricultural field<br />\r\n\t- collaborate with the provincial MECs to ensure proper monitoring and evaluation of Division of Revenue Act (DoRA) funds.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Kok then proceeded to highlight the role of portfolio committees on oversight. Their legislative functions were to do with considering, amending, approving or rejecting legislation. In respect of budgets, they were to consider and approve budgets and monitor expenditure of the Departments and entities reporting to them. They were to consider progress reports from line function departments and provincial and local government authorities and entities on their respective mandates. The accountability role involved ensuring that all appropriate executive organs of state in their portfolio were held accountable for their actions, or oversee the executive authority and consult or liaise with any other executive organ of state and make recommendations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe points that portfolio committees should bear in mind when dealing with performance monitoring were outlined. Committees should ask whether:<br />\r\n\t- the strategic plans and APP for entities were aligned to the National Development Plan<br />\r\n\t- entities had adequate human and financial resources available to enable them to achieve their&nbsp; predetermined objectives<br />\r\n\t- targets were realistic<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Kok made the point that committees should review annual achievements of predetermined objectives by entities (as stated in their Annual Report), and should also approve and track changes to strategic plans and annual performance reports.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe outlined the assurance roles, respectively, for the sector. Senior management should take immediate action to address specific recommendations, and adhere to financial management and internal control systems. Accounting Officers must hold officials accountable on implementation of internal controls and report progress quarterly and annually. The Executive authority must monitor the progress of performance and enforce accountability and consequences.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAssurance also occurred within the oversight roles. National Treasury and the Department of Public Service and Administration (DPSA) were to monitor compliance with laws and regulations and enforce appropriate action. The internal audit should be following up on management&rsquo;s actions to address specific recommendations and conducting its own audits on the key focus areas in the internal control environment, and reporting on quarterly progress. The Audit Committee must monitor risks and the implementation of commitments on corrective action made by management, as well as quarterly progress on the action plans. The oversight mechanisms in Parliament must review and monitor quarterly progress on the implementation of action plans to address deficiencies. The Public Accounts Committees must exercise specific oversight, on a regular basis, on any report where it may deemed necessary. The National Assembly committees provided independent oversight on the reliability, accuracy and credibility of National and provincial government.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe emphasised that clean administration improved service delivery by creating a better and dignified life for the citizens of South Africa through timely effective, efficient and economical service delivery.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, he noted that there were remedies to hold people to account and to address transgressions and poor performance. These included calling for reports, investigating any failure to comply with legislated obligations and responsibilities; or unauthorized, irregular and fruitless and wasteful expenditure; possible fraud and corruption; poor work performance of officials and suppliers; and other non-compliance with legislation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong><em>Discussion </em></strong><br />\r\n\tMs A Steyn thanked AGSA for the information and commented on the need to look at the root causes and the departments/entities involved. She required clarity on the audit outcomes, which looked like a regression. She expressed displeasure over the unreliability of information, pointing out that the predetermined objectives were problematic from the start. There were plans with no specific targets; compliance with regulations was a problem; strategic planning was not happening, and so she asked how it was possible to have an unqualified opinion, derived on the basis of money spent, although this had not translated into performance delivery<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Kok replied that the entities showing the root cause of slow responses by management were ARC, OBP, MLRF and DAFF. The entities with root cause of key officials&#39; lack of appropriate competences were DAFF and NAMC. The Department had a root cause of lack of consequences for poor performance and transgressions. He elaborated that the four entities that had good quality of submitted financial statements were OBP, NAMC, MLRF and DAFF while ARC required intervention on the quality of submitted financial statements. He added that all five entities required intervention on the quality of submitted performance reports. OBP had good supply chain management; DAFF and MLRF required intervention on their supply chain management while there were concerns on ARC and NAMC supply chain management. The financial health of NAMC and ARC were good, but that of MLRF, DAFF and OBP were a cause for concerns. The Human Resource management for OBP, MLRF and NAMC were good while DAFF and ARC were concerns. The Information technology for DAFF was good; OBP required intervention while ARC, NAMC and MLRF were concerns.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Nkau commented that there were six focus areas that made up a clean audit. These were:<br />\r\n\t- quality of submitted financial statements<br />\r\n\t- quality of submitted performance reports<br />\r\n\t- supply chain management compliance (rules and regulations)<br />\r\n\t- financial health (the liquidity and sustainability of an entity)<br />\r\n\t- human resource management<br />\r\n\t- information technology<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe added that the quality of the financial statements had an impact on the audit report. The financial health may not reflect in the audit report, unless there was an identified risk that was a material concern. Human resource management, depending on the extent of the materiality of the finding, may not reflect in the audit report. Information technology would only reflect in the management report, and not the audit report. There was a regression in the performance information which would be reflected in the audit report. The regressions related to the number of incidences identified, but this did not necessarily mean material regression. If an institution was not financially healthy it would be unable to deliver services. If the information provided by the Information technology security was not what it should be, then the information provided for audit on a quarterly basis might not be reliable, and that would be a concern.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe explained further that if an entity had a financially unqualified report, with or without findings yet did not meet its targets, AGSA would set this out in the annual performance report. AGSA reported factually, and could report that an entity had used the money, but did not meet its targets. In relation to the compliance to rules and regulations, AGSA would have reported that there was irregular expenditure, but this did not have a bearing on the fact that the audit report was financially unqualified, but showed findings in relation to compliance with rules and regulations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMost departments and entities would give reasons that they did not have sufficient budget to meet their targets, which was why they showed spending, but not reaching of targets. AGSA, in its reports on the performance information, reported on the usefulness of the information (and that involved whether the target indicators met the SMART principles) and reliability (whether sufficient audit evidence was provided). There had been findings on the usefulness of DAFF, NAMC and OBP targets, that&nbsp; were not measurable and inconsistent, so AGSA could not approve the validity, accuracy and completeness. That indicated that reliability was a real problem at DAFF.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Nkau pointed out that entities and departments had a finance unit that looked at the financial information and service delivery. This implied that the people in those units must be qualified and there must be proper performance management process. Performance management was critical in an organisation, to make sure that the targets and the indicators set in the Strategic Plan and Annual Performance Plan (APP) were met. If individual roles and responsibilities in an organisation were not identified it could not deliver; hence the need to have entities monitored and evaluated for service delivery. The action plans should detail the actions to address the root causes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Fanie Kok commented that the audit done in 2014/15 showed that the consistency of DAFF information was unclear, hence not useful.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr B Joseph (EFF) required clarity on material adjustments which were commented upon in the unqualified opinion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Z Jongbloed (DA) commented that AGSA had been struggling for the past five years with internal audits, as it had been recorded repeated findings. She asked how concerns about lack of proper record keeping, action plans, daily and monthly controls could be addressed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr M Filtane (UDM) asked if a political head, such as the Deputy Minister, was present at the meeting as some of the questions should be addressed to a political head.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson replied that the political heads would be present at the next meeting, and only the teams from entities briefing the Committee were present at these preparatory meetings.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Filtane asked why the recruitment process was ineffective, as the audit committee had only one staff member. The reliability of information was a problem for the Department, but that should be able to be sorted out, if both the political leadership of the Department and top management were to suffer consequences. He said lack of consequences for unreliability of information supplied would not lead to any reduction in the problems. Elaboration was required on the commitments made by the Minister which were not met. He asked for steps taken to improve on daily and monthly controls and asked what the senior management was doing to improve on the quality of performance reports, both in long term and short term. He asked why the DAFF employed incompetent staff and what was done to address the issue of staff incompetence.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson commented that some of those questions must be directed to the Department at the next meeting. AGSA, which could be seen as &quot;partner&quot; to the Committee on oversight could not answer some questions. The Auditor-General was to audit the finished product, while the Committee monitored the daily basis of the Department to assess whether the department was performing. AGSA could only confirm if information received from the Department was correct and whether money received was rightly appropriated.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Nkau thanked the Chairperson for clarifying the mandate of the AGSA as well as the role of the Portfolio Committee. She confirmed that the mandate of the AGSA was to audit and to report, while its engagement with the Accounting officers, the Executives, the Oversight Committee was as required by the International Standards of Auditing. Its engagement with the Portfolio Committee was to give the Committee an understanding of the audit report. The Portfolio Committee was responsible for holding the Department and management accountable. The AGSA would indicate the root causes of its findings and the key controls that were lacking, so that the Portfolio Committee could in turn hold the Department accountable for service delivery and work towards clean audit outcomes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr T Ramokhoase (ANC) required elaboration on the role of the Portfolio Committee on assurance. He added that the issue of performance management was not part of the audit opinion and outcomes of the AGSA and asked how deep the issue of human resources had to be to affect the audit opinion. He asked if the key commitments made by the Minister were new, or recurring from past Ministerial engagements, and what impact this had on the DAFF.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Nkau commented that the commitments that the previous Ministers gave to AGSA were sufficient to address the findings raised. The commitments that the new Minister gave would add value to the impact that the Departments would have.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson commented on the challenges of strategic plans that were unrelated to the annual performance plans, which hampered the AGSA audit performance, and asked how best the Portfolio Committee could assist the AGSA to get relevant reliable information that would assist them to do their work.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Nkau commented that, on a yearly basis, the AGSA reviewed the strategic plan for the next financial year. The strategic plan for 2015/16 would be reviewed by early next year and only the usefulness of planned targets could be audited. Reliability would be judged on the achievements reported. The report was then submitted to management before being presented to the Portfolio Committee. The Portfolio Committee could assist by interrogating the APP, asking questions around usefulness when engaging with the Department, and monitor achievements on a quarterly basis.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Steyn asked if AGSA and DPME ever met as a team to strategise and plan together, and requested that the financial report be improved for clarity, as had been mentioned last year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Nkau replied that AGSA met with DPME and had on a number of occasions conducted training together for the Department. The strategic plan and APP of the Department must reflect the impact. She noted requests for the next financial report.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson asked if there were responses from the Department to some of the issues raised by the AGSA in the legacy report.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Content Adviser to the Committee replied that some of the issues had been addressed while some audit outcomes of 2013/14 had not been addressed by the audit committee, and others were ongoing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Financial and Fiscal Commission (FFC) briefing</strong><br />\r\n\tMr Bongani Khumalo, Chief Executive Officer, Financial and Fiscal Commission, noted that the the Commission (FFC) was an independent, permanent, statutory institution established in terms of Section 220 of the Constitution. It functioned in terms of the FFC Act. The mandate of the Commission was to make recommendations, as envisaged in chapter 13 of the Constitution or in national legislation, to Parliament, Provincial Legislatures and any other organ of state determined by national legislation. He gave a brief background into the Commission.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe noted that the National Development Plan (NDP) envisaged the agriculture sector as one of the key levers for job creation and ensuring food security in South Africa. The NDP identified the following objectives for the sector:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t-create one million jobs in agriculture, agro processing and related sectors by 2030<br />\r\n\t-increase investments in new agricultural technologies and research and development<br />\r\n\t-realise a food surplus with 1/3 of food being produced by small-scale farmers or households<br />\r\n\t-create security of tenure for communal farmers, especially women<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDAFF had aligned its plans over the medium term with the NDP. by putting the focus on spending for increasing food production, by supporting smallholder farmers through Comprehensive Agricultural Support Programme (CASP), implementation of food security initiatives including land care, Illima/Letsema and the recently established Fetsa Tlala food production initiative, as well as by implementation of transformation frameworks to promote broader participation in the economy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Sasha Peters, Senior Researcher, FFC, briefed the Committee on the departmental overview. DAFF consisted of six programmes: Administration, Agricultural Production Health and Food safety, Food security and Agrarian Reform, Trade Promotion and Market access, Forestry and Fisheries. Six entities reported to and fell under the budget of DAFF. The mandate addressed production and consumption in agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors. Strategic goals of the Department included increasing production and productivity in the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors, enhancing employment and economic growth, food security, and sustainable use of natural resources.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe outlined the budget and programmes of DAFF and noted that between 2013/14 and 2014/15, the budget allocated to DAFF had increased from R6.1 billion to R6.6 billion, representing an increase of 3.1%. Over the medium term, allocations to DAFF were expected to decline due to Cabinet approved budget reductions and shifting the management function of the Knysna indigenous forest to the Department of Environmental Affairs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tProvincial audit outcomes: whilst dropping from the standard set in 2003/04 where all provincial DAFFs received unqualified opinions, had since 2005/06 shown that no provincial DAFF had obtained an adverse opinion, and since 2006/07 no provincial DFF had received a disclaimer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe noted that the DAFF was the transferring agent for three conditional grants - the CASP, the Illima Letsema and Land Care. FFC had some recommendations to make on the agriculture grants. Its annual submission for the 2007/08 Division of Revenue Bill had recommended that the Land Care Grant and CASP grants be merged into one. The rationale for the recommendation was based on overlapping objectives and poor spending performance. Even to date, the conditional grant spending performance within certain provinces remained poor, particularly on CASP. There was continued implementation of numerous existing (and underperforming) and new initiatives, with overlapping objectives.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFFC then summarised what its submissions were to be for the 2015/16 financial year. DAFF should strengthen its ability to enforce the conditions in the grant framework, to ensure better oversight of provinces, so that spending and performance of agricultural conditional grants cold be improved. The Commission would be suggesting&nbsp; that norms and standards be developed to assess the performance of provinces, and five year evaluations of conditional grants should be institutionalised. The Commission recommended also that there should be a special focus on improving the operations of different food security programmes, especially Agriculture, EPWP and the School Nutrition Programme. All these could accelerate improvements in household food security, without necessarily increasing programme expenditure. Areas that could yield improved results included better joint planning and streamlining procurement processes, with the assistance of the Chief Procurement Officer. The ability to use available resources optimally for the food security programmes had declined over time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFFC also recommended that Government should ensure that municipalities developed their own climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies and plans for climate change, as part of the Integrated Development Planning process. Government should provide support to municipalities by both location and capacity. Government should consider providing municipalities with performance-based conditional grants which rewarded or incentivised actions that were environmentally efficient and responsive to the adaptation and mitigation challenges of climate change.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFFC also felt that the governance and institutional arrangements for rural development across the three spheres of government needed to be clarified urgently. The fiscal framework (both equitable share and conditional grant allocation) for rural and agricultural development must be reviewed. Government should merge current conditional grants into a comprehensive agriculture and rural development finance programme, preferably administered by one department. The Land Care grant and Comprehensive Agricultural Support Programme grant should be merged into one Schedule 4 grant.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe concluded that the NDP envisaged a major role for DAFF in creating employment and growth, and ensuring food security. Generally there was concern about the spending, but there was also concern that the achievement of targets was low and there was widespread under spending of grants in general, as a result of weak procurement processes in provincial DAFFs. The internal controls within DAFF needed to be improved, particularly to ensure that performance targets were specific, measurable and verifiable, and it must put measures in place to prevent irregular expenditure, and carry out risk assessments and implementing risk management strategies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong><em>Discussion</em> </strong><br />\r\n\tMs Steyn asked how long Mr Khumalo had been acting as the Chairperson of the Commission. She expressed concern at performance of the conditional grants . She asked how the Portfolio Committee could assist to ensure that recommendations worked. She expressed concern on costs, which could be cut down due to under spending and lack of proper spending.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Bongani Khumalo replied that he had been acting as the Chairperson of the Commission for a period of four years (since 2010).The Commission did not need any more power than it currently had because the Commission must advise and make expert recommendations to Parliament. It must strengthen the ability of Parliament to deal with financial and fiscal matters of the state. The Commission was not facing any risk that would affect or impact it from delivering on its mandate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Filtane asked what the most prevalent risks were that threatened the Commission&rsquo;s effectiveness to deliver on its mandate, and whether these related to the political or economic environment. He asked why local government always got small allocations from the national fiscus, and how the budget reduction would impact on job creation. He wondered about the cost of establishing a single sustainable job in the agricultural sector. He pointed out that the marine sector had consistently under spent on these grants, and enquired what the FFC findings were on the reasons for the under spending. He enquired who, and for what reason held the view that food security was not the mandate of the local government and why there was playing off of local government in regard to food production.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Khumalo replied that, politically, there was no threat to the Commission&#39;s work. The Commission operated directly from the Constitutional mandate, looking to the rights of individuals, the mandate and where they lay. For instance, provinces had a responsibility in terms of education, to ensure that they provided education.&nbsp; If they were to provide secure school environment, as a right, the Commission should be able to say that the education sector thus needed more money to provide for a secure school environment. If school children were to be fed, the Commission must be in a position to say that school children were entitled to food. The Constitution was clear on progressive realisation, which was possible when there were plans. The Commission must define a set of norms and standards for all the services provided by the different spheres of government.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLocal government was the sphere that was closest to the people. If local government did not have the resources to operate and make sure it generated the benefits people would not go to the national level, but to the municipalities. DAFF should be playing a more critical and direct coordinating role across the spheres. Issues of co ordination were critical, especially the issue of job creation, as a working environment must be created for people to be productive. There was an assumption that local government always raised a substantial amount of revenue on its own. Over time, the economy changed and the local government revenue suffered. The share of money that went to the local government remained untouched, and that recognised that there were significant challenges in the local government spheres that should be dealt with. The share of local government needed to be looked at in the manner that the national department could be able to spend on their programmes, which was why it was critical that whatever the national department did was linked to the local government.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Khumalo said that the cost of creating a single sustainable job in the agricultural sector was unknown. Most jobs created in the sector were temporary or seasonal jobs, which were not sustainable jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Peters added that the under spending in the marine entity was driven by continued deferment of funds. If the entity did not spend in a particular year the funds were deferred to the next year, and this happened on a continuous basis. General under spending by the DAFF was driven by the National level or the provinces, and the conditional grants were driven by delays or incomplete procurement processes. This directly linked to the need for tightening the internal controls. The Commission&rsquo;s recommendation for 2015/16 (which government was yet to respond to) suggested that these procurement processes must be streamlined, that there be consideration of the role of the chief procurement officer and the role that office could play in assisting procurement processes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr C Maxegwana (ANC) commented that the background of the presentation spelt out what was expected from DAFF, in relation to the National Development Plan, on food security and employment. The 2008 economic downturn and its effect on the economic wealth of the country was an unanticipated shock. He asked how the country could be expected to deliver on the National Development Plan despite the unexpected problems and how the country could &quot;cushion&quot; the effects. He asked for more elaboration on budget spent and low achievements, reminding the Committee that funds were disbursed to Provinces for specific purposes, but there was no service delivered, and that needed to be interrogated.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Khumalo replied that when budget increased without meeting the set targets it meant there were inefficiencies in the system that needed to be addressed. Either resources were allocated to the wrong place or technically the wrong factors of production were being used.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson commented that the work of FFC helped government to have fiscal policy that responded to the needs of people on the ground and assisted government on the areas of focus to achieve a particular objective. The 2003 decision of the Heads of State of SADC was that all African Countries should budget 10% of their budgets to agriculture. However, given the recommended reduction in budget due to under spending, she asked how the Portfolio Committee could ensure that there was service delivery. She asked if FFC had a relationship with the Public Service Commission which was to ensure that the public services did their job and that the structure of government was responding to the needs of the community, like creation of employment. She added that rural development was a national function and there was no coordination of government in terms of the rural development structure developed by National Government. She agreed with the merging of grants, but was worried about the speed with which the Department had moved with the merger. Targets had to be implemented. Food security policies needed to be implemented and social grants needed to be looked into, as these occupied a big space in the national budget. The challenge of value for money was a problem that should be addressed in the country. She was impressed at the recommendations. The Portfolio Committee would fight for the implementation, as it was in the interest of the community. She asked how the Committee could work together with the Commission to ensure that things fell into place with the reduced budget. She commented that there was no department that made proper research into climate change and response of the sector to climate challenges. A lot of work had to be done in fisheries transformation. Transformation was not an easy process but must be done. She asked how growth could be assured in the country.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Khumalo replied that some work was taking place in the merging of conditional grants but he was not sure of the pace. The issue of grants in agriculture came up after 2003 and a task team was set up to look into it. The grants had shown some improvements in terms of performance, compared to the long history of poor performance where there was zero spending in some provinces. The Land Reform process and the utilization of land for food security purposes were two linked processes. In designing funding or a&nbsp; financial framework, the bigger picture had to be considered. The person that made decisions at the lower level must be able to respond to the local circumstances otherwise the whole purpose of decentralization would lose its meaning. In times of tight fiscal frameworks, the non performance became the first victim and the key challenges had to be dealt with by the department. The recommendations were processed by the National Treasury and sent through the various budget process forums. Over time, a lot of recommendations had been made, with which government could agree or not. Where government did not agree it meant there was no follow up. The expectation when recommendations were made was that Parliament had been empowered and that recommendations were being referred to the relevant Minister and Parliament would take responsibility for taking the Commission to task on what informed these recommendations. Parliament would be able to engage with the executive while National Treasury officials coordinated the process. There was a process whereby if there was no response from the various departments, then National Treasury must respond. If job creation was one of the programmes that government was looking at, then programmes that were aimed to facilitate job creation would be designed. If the programmes were not met, then there was a challenge. The tight fiscal environment had been sustained through foreign savings.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe relationship between the Public Service Commission (PSC) and FFC involved looking at programmes which dealt with corruption, looking at how resources were being utilized, identifying wastage of resources and allocating resources in order to deal with the challenges. It had to do with the efficiency of how work was done and that was what PSC was interested in. The FFC was mainly interested in technical efficiency and efficiency of allocations, such as whether resources were allocated to the areas of greatest need, to deal with the challenges; allocating efficiency; whether resources were allocated to the areas of greatest needs in order to deal with the challenges. The Commission had been working together with the Food Agriculture and National Resources (FANR), UCT and two other universities on a report about the vulnerability of communities and their coping mechanisms, with specific reference to some areas of Eastern Cape and Limpopo. The report would be finalized and tabled before the Committee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Steyn expressed concern that there was not enough planning in the Department and asked if it was possible for a province to get more money for specific projects.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson commented that some questions should be left over for deliberation among the Committee members. The Department could not account for grants as they did not know the number of small farmers they had assisted or whether the money appropriated was given to someone else. MPs should be demanding space to pay oversight visits, to ensure that things were being done properly, and show commitment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Khumalo commented that the Commission had tried to ensure that accounting officers at national level must be equally accountable for the conditional grants they transferred. In some sectors, for instance the Deportment of Human Settlements, where provinces had not performed, the money could be shifted to another province that was performing, but there should be solid plans around those grants. When the reviews of these grants were completed the way forward would be known. He suggested that the reviews must be treated urgently.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson thanked the Commissioner and said that the merging of grants would be prioritised and DAFF had to be pressurized to finalise on this. Parliament should never allow the people to pay for sins that they had not committed; instead, the officials must be made to work and government should take action where there was no service delivery.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Department of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME) on the 2013/14 Annual Performance of DAFF</strong><br />\r\n\tMs Tsakani Ngomane, Deputy Director General, DPME, briefed the Committee on the outcomes system which was introduced in 2009 to achieve more effective spending and performance. The aims were to increase the strategic focus of government by focusing on a limited number of priority outcomes,increase focus on measurable results, improve coordination across departments and spheres of government by introducing holistic government plans, move away from a culture of doing the same activities the same way again and again without consideration of the impacts of those activities to develop a culture of continuous improvement). DPME tracked government performance against 14 Outcomes. Outcome 7 focused on Rural Development, with DRDLR as the lead department, supported by DAFF and other departments.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOutcome 7 envisaged vibrant, equitable and sustainable rural communities and food security for all. Under this outcome, the outputs included:<br />\r\n\t- Output 1: sustainable agrarian reform with a thriving farming sector.<br />\r\n\t- Output2: improved access to affordable and diverse food.<br />\r\n\t- Output3: improving rural services to support livelihood<br />\r\n\t- Output4: improved employment and skills development opportunities<br />\r\n\t- Output 5: enabling institutional environment for sustainable and inclusive growth.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf achieved these would result in sustainable agrarian transformation with a thriving farming sector:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe target for 2014 was that 24.5m ha be transferred to marginalised groups, from 1994, but this was unlikely to be achieved. A delivery agreement was acquired, and the target to allocate 1.14 m ha of strategically located land between 2009 and 2014 had been achieved.50 000 new smallholders by 2014 could possibly be achieved.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVarious policies were restricting agrarian transformation. The policy and legal environment related to land ownership and use had in the past been conducive to agrarian transformation and development of the agricultural sector. A number of Acts had, however, dealt with subdivisions, changes in land use and agricultural land, resulting in a duplication of legislation and overlapping of departmental actions and responsibilities. This impeded on DAFF&#39;s ability to protect and preserve agricultural land and to ensure its productive use.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe target for Food Security, by way of establishing community, institutional and school food gardens to enable at least 30% of poor households to produce some of their own food, was that 68 000 be established by 2014, and this had been achieved.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHowever, between 10% and 15% of households were still vulnerable to hunger in 2011 and 22.7% had insufficient access to food.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHE noted the employment figures and said that the CASP conditional grant created a total of 9 932 jobs (permanent: 2 085; temporary or seasonal jobs: 7 847).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMoving on the findings by AGSA, he summarised the findings again, particularly the matters of emphasised in relation to Predetermined objectives (performance information, strategic planning and management); Audit Committee not in place; Ineffective Internal audit; Procurement and contract management (e.g. quotations not obtained);insufficient oversight on reporting; insufficient human resources (internal audit, regional offices and SMS positions);Risk assessment not conducted; Risk management strategy not in place; expenditure management(to prevent irregular expenditure) and transfer of funds.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome key lessons emerged from the analysis of data and good practice, in relation to :<br />\r\n\t- Commitment: accountable leadership and consistency of purpose and a professional service culture.<br />\r\n\t- Management Practices: aligned policy, planning and performance review systems; organization, structures, processes, resources and norms.<br />\r\n\t- Improved performance management could have a notable influence on improving management practice.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDPME suggested that for the future, there should be a comprehensive rural development policy and food security for all approach, which would be based on the NDP policy imperatives. The NDP identified the following priorities which now comprised the focus of Outcome 7 for the period 2014-2019.<br />\r\n\t- Improved land administration and spatial planning for integrated development.<br />\r\n\t- Up-scaled rural development as a result of coordinated and integrated planning, resource allocation and implementation by all stakeholders.<br />\r\n\t- Sustainable land reform<br />\r\n\t- Improved food security<br />\r\n\t- Smallholder farmer development and support for agrarian transformation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDAFF must now implement the comprehensive food security and nutrition strategy and develop under-utilised land in communal areas and land reform projects for production. Under sub-outcome 5, for the development and support of small producers, DAFF must develop and implement policies promoting the development and support of smallholder producers; expand land under irrigation; provide support to smallholder producers in order to ensure production efficiencies; develop and implement the Agricultural Policy Action Plan (IAPAP); develop, resource and implement the Agricultural Value Chain.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Ngomane concluded that the disappointing growth in the sector and loss of jobs in the sector could be attributed in part to the global economic decline, but DAFF had not been successful in addressing constraints to investment in the sector. Although DAFF had embarked on some&nbsp; strategies such as mechanisation aimed at stimulating production by smallholders, the following concerns remained:<br />\r\n\t- DAFF&rsquo;s programmes were not having significant impact on key indicators<br />\r\n\t- there was not yet sufficient transforming of the sector through new entrants becoming successful commercial farmers<br />\r\n\t- there was slow growth of the industry both in terms of contribution to GDP and employment<br />\r\n\t- household food security and under-utilization of agricultural land remained of concern.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCauses of problems appeared to include weak relationships between governments and the industry, and high senior management vacancy levels. In addition, DAFF and DRDLR were not working closely enough together. The DPME recommended that the DAFF should strengthen collaboration with the established commercial farming sector to develop black commercial farmers, use government procurement more to create opportunities for black commercial farmers, and review and accelerate initiatives to strengthen agricultural support to black commercial farmers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong><em>Discussion </em></strong><br />\r\n\tMs Steyn thanked the presenter for the broad overview and noted that there was a statement in the agricultural sector that it was not possible to manage what could not be measured. She stressed that the country would not move forward if there was no data measurement. She needed more explanation on employment figures of CASP conditional grants. The agricultural sector contribution in growing the domestic sector had declined, hence the need to find out what the problem was. She wondered if the policy uncertainties were in part to blame and pointed out that farmers were not making money in South Africa any more, due to high electricity costs, expensive land and other matters. There was a need to look at the problems and address them squarely. The number of farms in South Africa had declined over the years. 26% of the South African population was facing hunger, while 28% were at risk and food security had become a massive problem, withe people not having money to buy food, or there being no food available. Proper plans were needed to address these problems, and hence the need for dialogue.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Ngomane agreed on the need for dialogue in the sector. It was important that there be honest engagements that considered the realities. The methodology of operation could give&nbsp; that platform or opportunity for dialogue, from the commercial sector or subsistence producers or financial institutions. It was becoming more urgent f to have a discussion as the longer the delays, the more that people became impatient and resorted to undesirable actions. She agreed that data that could not be measured could not be achieved. She said DPME was drawing lessons from the previous administration to provide numbers by focusing more on performance measures and functionality, such as how many of the distributed farms were engaged productively by pushing for portfolios of evidence to go with the reports that came through the system, unlike the system followed prior to this, and by carrying out physical oversight work to sites. The medium term strategic framework was the framework of government, which was a direct translation of the objectives as identified by the NDP, to say what was to be implemented and assigned to the Ministers. For instance, DAFF should engage with the Provinces to get their share of the targets set out in the MTFS which are split - based on areas of potential for each province. She commented on the food security data analysis that 10% to15% of households were vulnerable to hunger, while 22.7% had insufficient access to food.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Ramokhoase commented that the presentation was fair and transparent. He said it was a political mind shift that was needed, and asked if political decisions should be allowed to prevail as political issues must be dealt with the aim of addressing poverty in order to secure food. He was happy that the Presidency itself was able to determine the issue of the poor numbers, and said that poor numbers were getting the country deeper into problems every day, and some people merely fought to hold on to the current situation, but that was not resolving any problems.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Ngomane replied that the impact of the commercial sector was due to high cost of farming and challenges of the commercial sector in making reasonable profit margin within the sector. The transformation agenda would determine the extent to which the commercial sector would continue to thrive, with the participation of many. The experience around recapitalisation was not good enough as lands were transferred to beneficiaries but in effect these lands were still owned by the strategic partners; hence the need for political will and the manner in which dialogue had been used to get to this stage.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Maxegwana commented that food gardens only addressed a component of food security, so that&nbsp; other production interventions needed to be considered, such as increasing livestock productivity. He agreed that there was not a focus on where the strengths lay - such as Eastern Cape, where livestock production was prevalent - because those strengths were not developed. He suggested that there was a need to improve interventions in livestock production in Eastern Cape. The Department was not doing enough on food gardens, as it should ensure that activists within the Department ensured the sustenance of food gardens, which addressed hunger, and would in turn offload social grants. Rural development gave lands to people for agriculture; hence the need to improve interventions on small holder farmers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Ngomane replied that food gardens should not be undermined. The challenge was for that everyone should be tackling community gardens at all scales across provinces and in urban settings.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson commented that the target for agriculture for last year on Fetsa Tlatla was a problem and there was need for a dialogue on how to improve on agriculture. She was happy that the DPME was starting to pick up on issues. The challenge in government was that many officials were &quot;taking chances&quot; - for instance, hiding information or hiding parts of budgets in goods and services. She agreed that critical issues were raised around baselines and data. Dialogue must be created to understand the sector betterment that it was seeking to achieve between national and provincial levels, but she was not sure how&nbsp;&nbsp; to make the Department and Provinces work together as there were no norms and standards. Building on capacity of the small farmers, including livestock farming, also required veterinary services. Provinces and the national Department all had different programmes with funds for those programmes but no one was making sure that those programmes actually reached the people. There cannot be livestock farming without providing veterinary services. Occupation Specific Dispensation (OSDs) was a problem with unresolved veterinary services. There was need to build human capital, to have functional agricultural colleges and to consider the role of the Department of Higher Education. The DPME should get DAFF to have a working monitoring subsection, and she wondered if this could be done under the Department. Evaluation tools were important as the performance management system had loopholes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Ngomane replied that DPME was trying to encourage departments to move away from reporting on activities and outputs at the macro level. The Committee could request the Department to come and present the evaluation report that focused on specific programmes. DPME was evaluating the Extension Recovery Programme translating into quality extension services. Alignment was also required at the national level between the Department of Agriculture, Rural development, and National Treasury having a common funding. DPME had a budget review or hearing process involving a joint sitting between Agriculture, Rural development and Treasury, looking at their budget cases. Agricultural colleges needed to be strengthened, with strong collaboration from established higher education institutions. Some colleges did not have programmes for supporting extension services, and no allocations to strengthen the colleges. Development of the curriculum was required to strengthen colleges. Weaknesses in the Public service were to be addressed by establishing generic tools to strengthen the service.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Steyn asked why the agricultural census was terminated, which was a massive blow to the industry and country.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson replied that DAFF would answer that at the next meeting. She noted that in most communities that faced the fight on restitution of land, the people involved were public servants and she asked that this phenomenon be researched. She noted that the DPME did not talk about Fisheries and Forestry and how performance could be measured.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Ngomane replied that the systems were not that good, so it was difficult to work with alignment. A person would need to be an activist to have a sense of ownership. DPME carried out monitoring on officials causing fights.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Committee Oversight Report: Ncera farms (Pty) Ltd, 23 September, 2014: Consideration and adoption</strong><br />\r\n\tMr B Joseph (EFF) indicated that it was difficult for him to support the recommendation of the previous Committee of the Fourth Parliament on the winding up of Ncera farms.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson replied that there was a decision to de-register Ncera Farms as an entity, which was the main reason for the oversight visit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Joseph contested the phrase in the draft Report expressing &ldquo;in-principle support &ldquo;as he was not part of the decision.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson commented that the objection of Mr Joseph was noted.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Steyn suggested that it be rephrased, to say that the majority of the Committee agreed in principle.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe majority of Members, whilst noting the objection of Mr Joseph, adopted the report and the decision to de-register Ncera Farms.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Committee minute adoption </strong><br />\r\n\tThe Committee unanimously adopted the minutes of the meeting held on 16 September 2014.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe meeting was adjourned.</p>\r\n",

        "summary": "<p>The Auditor General of South Africa (AGSA) briefed the Committee on the audit outcomes for the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) and its entities for the 2013/14 financial year. This was intended to provide Members with the necessary information and guidance to enable the Portfolio Committee to effectively execute their oversight function. The financial statements, performance and compliance with legislation were described. The DAFF and the entities Marine Living Resources Fund (MLRF), National Agricultural Marketing Council (NAMC) and Onderstepoort Biological Products (OBP) had received unqualified audits. The Agricultural Research Commission (ARC) required intervention. However, all five entities of DAFF were not doing well in respect of the performance assessments and AGSA noted that interventions were required. Supply chain management was a problem in four entities, with only OBP being acceptable. The financial health of MLRF, DAFF and OBP was of concern. Human resource management was problematic at DAFF and ARC. Interventions were needed into ICT at OBP.&nbsp; Some common root causes were slow, sometimes regressive responses by management, key officials&rsquo; lack of competencies (which had not improved since the last report) and regressed lack of consequences for poor performance and transgressions. The status of key commitments by the Minister was noted, and it was particularly said that the strengthening of monitoring and evaluation units was under way. Matters still to be implemented included the need to make the internal audit function fully effective and functional, improve transparency in procurement, and investigate how the MLRF might have its own board. It was still necessary to implement plans to identify specific areas for service delivery, ensure linkages with targets in the strategic plan, support the agricultural schools, and collaborate with provincial MECs. Finally, a summary was given of the role of the portfolio committees, how they conducted oversight, some guidance to them when dealing with performance monitoring, and the division of assurance roles. The Committee required clarity on the audit outcomes, root causes, assurance levels and material adjustments. They expressed concern that the DAFF had been struggling with internal audit for the past five years and asked what could be done to address the problem. Members were concerned about the ineffective recruitment process, asked why incompetent staff remained and stressed that consequences for providing unreliable information were needed. The relationship between AGSA and the DPME was questioned.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Financial and Fiscal Commission (FFC) then briefed the Committee on its role and functions, noting that it was established in terms of section 220 of the Constitution, and its mandate was explained. It noted that the National development Plan (NDP) envisaged the agriculture sector as one of the key levers for job creation and ensuring food security in South Africa, and identified some key objectives. DAFF had aligned its plans over the medium term with the NDP by ensuring that the spending focus over the medium term was on increasing food production, by supporting smallholder farmers through agricultural support, food security initiatives and implementation of transformation frameworks to promote broader participation in the economy. FFC summarised the programme structure of the DAFF, noted that the mandate encompassed production and consumption in agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors, and highlighted some of its strategic goals. A comparison of the budget and programmes was outlined, noting an overall increase in budget of 3.1% between 2013 and 2015, but it was also noted that the allocations were expected to decrease over the medium term. FFC then set out some of the provincial audit outcomes, but noted that no provincial DAFF had obtained an adverse audit opinion or disclaimer since 2005. DAFF was the transferring agent for three conditional grants, and FFC summarised its recommendations in respect of those grants. It had, amongst others, recommended the merger of the Land Care and CASP grants, because of poor performance, and the fact that there were several overlapping initiatives. DAFF should strengthen its ability to enforce conditions in the grant framework to ensure better oversight of the provinces, and FFC suggested that norms and standards must be developed to assess performance. In particular, it recommended a special focus on improving the food security programmes. It further believed that government must ensure that municipalities, possibly providing incentives for environmentally efficient actions. FFC also recommended that governance and institutional arrangements for rural development had to be urgently clarified and the fiscal framework reviewed. There were concerns both on the spending and the achievement of targets, and targets needed to be more measurable. The Committee Members shared the concern at spending without correlating achievements, and asked why local government received such small allocations and the impact of the budget reductions on job creation in the sector. They asked the cost of creating jobs in this sector, wondered why food security was not emphasised in the mandate of local government, and supported the FFC&#39;s recommendations on the conditional grants, but urged that this should be done with more speed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME) then highlighted the 2013/14 performance of the DAFF, noting the aims and objectives, and explaining how the DPME tracked government performance against 14 outcomes. culture of continuous improvement).DPME tracked government performance against 14 Outcomes. Outcome 7 focused on Rural Development with DRDLR as the lead department and supported by DAFF and other departments, and the sub-outputs were summarised. The target for 2014 was to have 24.5m ha transferred to marginalised groups, but this was unlikely to be achieved, although the delivery agreement to allocate 1.14 million ha between 2009 and 2014 had been reached. Policies that hindered agrarian transformation were explained, and the difficulties posed by current legislation were outlined.&nbsp; The DPME then presented a comparison of targets and achievements for food security, employment figures, the CASP grant, and summarised again the content of the audit report. DPME also said that improved performance management could have a notable influence on improving management practice. It recommended a greater focus on comprehensive rural development and food security for all, and NDP policy imperatives and priorities. DPME noted that the disappointing growth in the sector and loss of jobs in the sector could be attributed in part to the global economic decline but stressed that DAFF had not been successful in addressing constraints to investment in the sector and its policies did not impact significantly on key indicators or achieve transformation. There were weak relationships between government and the industry, and the DAFF and Department of Rural Development and Land Reform were not working closely enough together. Recommendations by DPME included that DAFF must strengthen collaboration with the established commercial farming sector to develop black commercial farmers, use government procurement more effectively and accelerate initiatives to strengthen agricultural support to black commercial farmers. Members expressed concern on the absence of data measurement and wanted elaboration on employment figures on CASP conditional grants, as well as more information on the root causes of the decline in the sector. They emphasised the importance of addressing food security and suggested that the DAFF must do more to promote food gardens and promote dialogue on improving the sector. Building on capacity of the small farmers including livestock production was a concern and the role of agricultural colleges were required.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Ms A Steyn (DA) commented that she was not sure if Ms Z Jongbloed (DA) had written an apology to arriving late.&nbsp; She apologized that she would be leaving by 12noon as well.</p>\r\n<p>.</p>\r\n<p>The Chairperson commented that the meeting was important in order for the Committee to know the legislation that governed the sector, and to see if the Department was ensuring there was enough legislation for the sector. &nbsp;This was necessary because she had been informed by the Parliamentary legal department that the previous Committee had been dealing with a court order that was due for hearing in January 2015.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Briefing by Committee support officials on DAFF legislation</strong></p>\r\n<p>Ms Desiree Swartz, Parliamentary Legal Adviser, briefed the Committee on the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA) judgment on the Performing Animals Protection Act (PAPA). The Act in Sections 2 and 3 gives power to the Magistrate to issues licences to people that use animals for performing purposes and security purposes. Section 3 dealt with the issuing of certificates.&nbsp; The NSPCA had taken the legislation, which was passed in 1935, to the Constitutional Court. The Court had said that giving a magistrate the power to issue licenses and certificates was invalid, as this should be an executive function, rather than a judiciary function, hence it violated the separation of powers. The Court declared Sections 2 and 3 of the Act invalid, but suspended the invalidity for 18 months. The judgment was handed down on 11 July 2013. The Department had been instructed to remedy it and bring legislation that would be passed by 10 January 2015.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The time frame left was short and the legislation had not yet been introduced. The Committee had an oversight function and could ask the Department to report on what was happening about the Legislation. A Committee Bill was an option, but it involved a lot of suspension of rules, and the processes involved in a Committee Bill may not be met before January 2015.&nbsp; The Department had the option of going back to the Constitutional Court to ask for an extension of the deadline in order to enable Parliament sufficient time to consider the Bill.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>\r\n<p>Ms Carter expressed concern that the Department had not been working on the legislation and had rather pushed the blame elsewhere. She asked for the guidelines in the processes to be followed, and what should have been followed.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Swartz replied that the court had not given guidelines in the judgment on what was required, so it was difficult for the Committee to come up with legislation without the assistance of the Department.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Steyn asked if there were other pieces of legislation outstanding with court cases, and the stipulated time frame to finalise them. She asked if the Department would be penalised if it did not implement it, as the only option left was to ask for an extension beyond January 2015.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Swartz replied that the Parliamentary legal department monitored the Constitutional Court judgments and would alert the Committee where necessary. The legal office was capacitated to receive judgments from the Court to see if any piece of legislation was declared invalid.</p>\r\n<p>The Chairperson asked if the Committee would be penalised if the deadline was not met.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Swarts replied that there was no penalty in the court judgment.</p>\r\n<p>The researcher commented that the internal processes of the legislative schedule plan within the directorate should have been completed by 1 August. &nbsp;Process with the state law advisers should have been completed as at 1 September.&nbsp; Work at the DG&rsquo;s office should have been completed by 1 October. Bills to be submitted should have been completed as at 1 November, and Parliament as at 1 December. There had been a shortcoming within the Department, so the deadline of 10 January 2015 would not be met.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Carter commented that it was important to see where the delays had come from, as the first draft had been completed in November 2013.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Steyn expressed concern that the Department had not included Performing Animal Protection Act Amendment Bill to the list of outstanding court cases requested by the Committee from the Department last year.</p>\r\n<p>The Chairperson commented that the Committee was not pleased by the Department&rsquo;s response, as the Department should have been the first to brief the Committee about the Court judgment, and not vice versa. She asked the researcher to brief the Committee on other legislations and policies that needed to be tackled.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Legislative Mandate of the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF)</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Committee Support Official gave an overview of the legislation mandate of DAFF. The Department had over 30 pieces of legislation, but she focused on the agricultural and food market cluster. She briefed the Committee on four pieces of legislation.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Agricultural Produce Agents Act of 1992, which controlled the Agricultural Produce Council, related to produce agencies like wholesalers, brokers, and export and import agents. The Department had proceeded to publish a Bill to change councils into an agency and empower an agency to approve new markets, for public comment. The new Bill would control new markets like abattoirs. There seemed to be a direct move to have more regulations to control the activities of the market. The Act sought to ensure that the food safety requirements were enforced by using various collaborating bodies. The Bill also gave the Department power to source funding for market infrastructure.</p>\r\n<p>The Agricultural Product Standard Act of 1990 controlled the sale and exports of certain agricultural products, as well as the packaging, labeling and microbiological standard of products.&nbsp; This involved role players like the Department of Health, which tested for contaminants like E.coli and salmonella, which are managed in certain ways. The Department had used the proposed amendment to harmonise the standards. The maximum residue level of pesticides used on agricultural products was monitored by some private companies too. The Department had introduced a draft Bill for public comment.</p>\r\n<p>The Liquor Products Act of 1989 applied to the wine and spirits sub-sector. The Bill had been published for public comment.</p>\r\n<p>The Marketing of Agricultural Products Act of 1996 gave effect to the National Agri-Marketing Association (NAMA) to establish markets, comparative advantages, levies and administration of bodies. &nbsp;The draft Bill, which sought to shift the function from NAMA to the Department itself, had been published by the Department for public comment.. The Department was given the power to be the sole custodian of agricultural and food market.</p>\r\n<p>There had been slow progress by the Department to finalise the Bills, and since 2009 only two had been brought to e Parliament and finalised.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Discussion </strong></p>\r\n<p>Ms Steyn commented that she would like to see a list of what the Department was planning to do this year, and what it was working on. Legislation did not stop people from finding loopholes, so it was important to enforce the implementation of these laws. She expressed concern about the outdated or outstanding legislation, which should be followed up with the Department.</p>\r\n<p>Mr T Ramokhoase (ANC) said that the situation had reached the point where concerns should be raised and addressed. The Committee should look at the best measures to put in place to make sure that it fulfilled its mandate and ensured that agriculture in South Africa became part of the survival platform for the people.</p>\r\n<p>The Chairperson commented that it was disturbing to look at what the Department was supposed to have done, and its progress in closing the gap. Concerns had been raised on the Bills, and these should be raised with the Department. There was a need to get commitments from the Department on the status of Bills sent for public comments, and the need to fast track all the processes. It would have to work with the legal unit to make sure that the Bills were implemented.</p>\r\n<p>Mr B Joseph (EFF) asked about the possibility of getting all the legislation that governed the sector.</p>\r\n<p>The Chairperson replied that it was possible.</p>\r\n<p>Mr C Maxegwana (ANC) said that it was important for the Committee to get the legislation in order to identify the pieces of legislation to be dealt with.</p>\r\n<p>The Chairperson suggested that the legislation be considered piecemeal, as the support officials could give an overview on it. The officials would make sure that Members received the legislation.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Steyn said the Department should be asked to provide a list of each section of legislation which could assist the Committee.</p>\r\n<p>The Chairperson welcomed the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, and invited the Department to give the Committee its programmme regarding the court order that would expire in January 2015.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Bheki Cele, the Deputy Minister thanked the Chairperson and Committee Members, and read an apology from the Minister, who would join the meeting later.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Progress report on the Performing Animal Protection Act (PAPA) Amendment Bill </strong></p>\r\n<p>Mr Moketsa Ramasodi, Acting Deputy Director General: Agricultural Production, Health and Food Safety, DAFF, briefed the Committee on issues relating to the Performing Animals Protection Amendment Bill. The Department was in the process of reviewing the legislation when the judgment had come to the Department. He gave a brief background to the Amendment Bill.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Constitutionality of Section 2 and 3 of the Performing Animals Protection Act (PAPA) of 1935 (Act No 24 of 1035) had been challenged by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA) during 2012. &nbsp;It gave power to magistrates to issue licenses for performing animals to respective industries.</p>\r\n<p>On 11 July 2013, the Constitutional Court of South Africa had declared sections 2 and 3 of the PAPA unconstitutional, as the Court found that the issuing of licences was an administrative function that should be performed by the executive, and not by the judiciary. The judgment also ordered Parliament to remedy the defect within 18 months from the day of the judgment, to expire 10 January 2015.</p>\r\n<p>The judgment affected a large number of operations involved in training and exhibiting wild animals, as well as security dog companies that depended on annual licences to operate, hence the need for the amendment to be processed without delay.</p>\r\n<p>The review process included the consolidation of the PAPA and the Animal Protection Act of 1962 (Act 71 of 1962) into one Animal Welfare Bill for consideration by Parliament. A holistic animal welfare policy in response to short and long term animal welfare matters had been drafted, and was currently undergoing formal Departmental processes.</p>\r\n<p>The DAFF had considered two options following the court judgement.&nbsp; The first was to consider technical amendments to the existing PAPA, focusing on Sections 2 and 3, while the second was to consider a total repeal of the PAPA Act and a replacement with new Animal Welfare Act.</p>\r\n<p>The Department opted to consider the first option, focusing on sections 2 and 3, because it was the only quick option, considering the time constraints. The consolidation of the envisaged amendments to sections 2 and 3 would not be concluded within the expected timeframes.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Ramasodi described the chronology of events. The Department had deliberated on the issue since the judgement and completed the first draft of the Bill in November 2013. This draft was referred to the Office of the State Law Adviser (OSLA) on 7 January 2014. The OSLA had reverted to the Department on 13 February, with comments regarding the workability of the bill due to incomplete processes and infringements of section 14 of the constitution, and alerted DAFF that the Bill was not in line with the principles of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act (PAJA).</p>\r\n<p>The draft amendment Bill was gazetted on 9 April. The Department considered all written and oral inputs and engaged OSLA in June and July 2014. The OSLA considered preliminary certification of the draft Bill on 5 September, and recommended that the Department should take care of a few minor issues. The memorandum was provided on 8 September and the Bill was preliminarily certified by the OSLA on 11 September.</p>\r\n<p>The OSLA returned the document with minor tracked changes, which were dealt with by the Department, and the final document was submitted on 12 September. &nbsp;The Bill was ready for tabling at the October 2014 Economic Sectors and Employment and for Infrastructure Development (ESEID) cluster meeting.</p>\r\n<p>The purpose of Bill required technical amendments to Sections 2 and 3 of PAPA to provide for:</p>\r\n<p>- &nbsp;the designation of a National Licensing officer;</p>\r\n<p>- &nbsp;a procedure for the application for a license to exhibit, train or use an animal;</p>\r\n<p>- &nbsp;the functions of a National Licensing Officer;</p>\r\n<p>- the issuance of licenses; and</p>\r\n<p>- the insertion of certain definitions and provision for an appeals process.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The objects of Bill were covered in Clauses 1 and 2, and would repeal sections 2 and 3, which dealt with magistrates issuing licenses for the exhibition and training of performing animals and for the use of dogs for safeguarding.&nbsp; These clauses were declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court on the basis that a member of the judiciary should not be performing administrative actions that were supposed to be performed by the Executive.</p>\r\n<p>Clauses 3 sets out a procedure for the granting and issuing of licences and matters connected therewith, thereby ensuring compliance with the Constitutional Court judgment.</p>\r\n<p>Clause 4 seeks to incorporate additional definitions into the Act that were consequential to the revised procedure adopted for the granting and issuing of licenses. Definitions for &ldquo;Animal scientists&rdquo;, &ldquo;Officer&rdquo;, &rdquo;National Licensing Officer&rdquo; and &ldquo;Veterinarian&rdquo; had been inserted.</p>\r\n<p>Clause 5 provides for an appeal process by the insertion of section 11A, which provides for the establishment of an ad hoc appeal board by the Minister, the appointment of members, the appointment and functions of the chairperson of the appeal board.</p>\r\n<p>Clause 6 provides for the short title of this Act upon its enactment.&nbsp; The PAPA 2014 would come into operation on a date fixed by proclamation in the Gazette.</p>\r\n<p>The draft Bill was published in the Gazette for public comments on 9 April 2014, and written comments were received from stakeholders like the SA Dog Academy, the NSPCA and the Animal Anti-Cruelty League.</p>\r\n<p>The implementation plan encompassed the Identification of service points and coordination of the change management process to be completed by October 2014, in collaboration with provincial Departments of Agriculture.&nbsp; The delegation of functions would be finalised after the promulgation with the National Licensing Officer.&nbsp; The development and harmonizing of standard operational procedures would be done between September and December, along with the provincial Departments of Agriculture.&nbsp; By September, there would be research and development by the Departments of Environmental Affairs, Tourism and Science and Technology, the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) and other strategic stakeholders. Monitoring and evaluation would be completed by January 2015, along with the DAFF, the NSPCA and other relevant stakeholders.</p>\r\n<p>The financial Implications were that the DAFF would realign its structure to accommodate the new designation. The budget for the new unit would in the short term be reprioritized within the current budget. Provincial Departments would be encouraged to utilize state veterinarians and animal scientists in different districts. A budget of R54 million would be required to carry the operations and structure of the National Licensing Officer, technical and administrative staff.</p>\r\n<p>The OSLA and DAFF were of the opinion that this Bill may have to be dealt only in accordance with the procedure established by section 75 of the Constitution. Parliament could further guide the tagging of this Bill. The OSLA and DFF also believed that it may not be necessary to refer this Bill to the National House of Traditional Leaders in terms of section 18(1)a, since it did not contain provisions pertaining to customary law or customs of traditional communities. Parliamentary guidance would be appreciated.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Chairperson said that the Department had submitted a list of Bills that must go to Parliament and there should be clarity in terms of the letter from the President. She expressed concern over the proposed Bill, which had not reached the Cabinet by September, as it still had to go through other processes before the set date. She asked if the target of January 2015 would be met, since the Bill had not yet reached Parliament.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Steyn said that the Committee had been informed about the Bill by the state law adviser, so it was aware of the Court order. She said there was other outstanding legislation that the Department had not brought to Parliament. She asked for a list of outstanding court orders in the Department and the implications of these court orders against the Department. She said that tagging should be done for the right reasons, and proposed that provinces should help with the tagging procedures. She expressed concern that the Department had opted for the first option, as it was a short legislative process that could be followed. She asked if the Department was following the right legal steps, without having to repeat the legislation, in order to meet the deadline.</p>\r\n<p>The Deputy Minister replied that it was important to have thoroughly prepared legislation, without having to undermine the contents of the legislation and the court&rsquo;s timeline, so there was a need for an extension to the deadline.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Carter expressed concern about how to set up the appeal process and the implications of the court order on the Department and provinces. She added that the 1935 Act had been specifically for circuses (performing animals) so she was worried about how to factor animal activism into the Bill process, as there should be a balance between animal activism and performing animals.</p>\r\n<p>The Deputy Minister replied that it was important to put in our best efforts into animal activism.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Ramokhoase said there was need to prepare for consequences that may come from the judgment. He asked if the Department had prepared for any consequences. &nbsp;He asked if the Department had tried to change Section 75 to 76, and if there were risks involved by exposing the Department to failure after such a loss of time..</p>\r\n<p>The Chairperson welcomed the Minister, Mr Senzeni Zokwana, and the Director General of DAFF, Prof Edith Vries.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Maxegwana asked if it was possible to delay the court judgment beyond 10 January, and what the implications of delaying it were.</p>\r\n<p>The Deputy Minister replied that the Minister could ask for an extension of the deadline.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Steyn asked for the background to the court case, and asked if there had been dealings between the NSPCA and DAFF before the legislation was taken to court.</p>\r\n<p>The Chairperson commented that the deadline would not be met, so the Department solicit an interaction with the Constitutional Court to get an extension.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Swartz said that legislation gave a legal framework for policies, so from January 2015 that sector would not be regulated anymore. The ideal option was to approach the Constitutional Court for extension.</p>\r\n<p>The Deputy Minister replied that the Department could request an extension.</p>\r\n<p>The Minister said that situation confirmed that people could still go to Court hence the department would ask for an extension. He added that the Department would be constitutional as animals would be at risks if shortcuts were taken.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Steyn commented that the discussion of this legislation review spanned almost two years and expressed concern about other outdated legislation that needed to be reviewed. She asked the Department to provide a list of legislative reviews that were unconstitutional, and asked if there was an office within the Department that reviewed legislation. The Department should talk about pieces of legislations whenever it came to present to the Committee.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Carter commented that it was important that the Department should apply for an extension within the timeframe.&nbsp; However she advised the Department to continue to work on the review process as though there were no extension.</p>\r\n<p>The Chairperson agreed that the Department should ask for an extension and inform the Committee. Department should work with the Parliamentary legal unit in order for the Committee to monitor progress on the legislation. The outstanding documents requested from the previous Committee had not been received to date. The Department should always respond promptly when requests were made by the Committee. A letter would be sent to the Minister from the Chairperson of the Committee outlining all the outstanding issues, and responses should come on time as the Committee had penalty measures that would be applied for late response.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Adoption of Minutes </strong></p>\r\n<p>Mr Z Mandela (ANC) moved for the adoption of the minutes of 9 September. Ms T Tongwane (ANC) seconded the motion. The minutes were adopted.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Ms Steyn moved the adoption of the minutes of 11 September.&nbsp; Mr Mandela seconded the motion. The minutes were adopted.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Oversight visit to Ncera Farms </strong></p>\r\n<p>Ms Albertina Kakakza, Committee Secretary, said that the visit to Ncera Farms had been approved for 23 September. The Portfolio Committee would meet with the provincial committee before proceeding to Ncera Farms to meet with the stakeholders and the chiefs of the two communities. Buffalo city municipality would participate in the meeting.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Feedback on Land Tenure Summit</strong></p>\r\n<p>Mr Ramokhose briefed the Committee on the Land Tenure Summit held by the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform which was attended by the Chairperson, Mr M Filtane (UDM), the Committee Secretary, the content adviser and himself. &nbsp;He read the objectives of the summit, which was aimed at soliciting the views of stakeholders. The summit was a national event, attended by directly affected stakeholders and people from the grassroots. &nbsp;Legislators, national executive authorities, organisations, farm workers and many others attended. It was opened by the Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform.</p>\r\n<p>The summit focused on communal land tenure policy, communal land tenure security, and property association etc. There were eight venues with different presenters, and it was an open summit. Issues raised by different commissions were highlighted, as people expressed concerns over the implementation of their ideas. Reports would be finalized and sent to different stakeholders.&nbsp; It was a successful summit.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Filtane said that the representatives had attended different commissions on the commission day. The Commission on Communal Land had considered whether land should be handed over to traditional or municipal councils, as there were opposing views. There was a suggestion that traditional leaders were not the most competent institutions to own land. People were anxious to have matters resolved and the Government had a responsibility to fast track the implementation of the views.</p>\r\n<p>The Chairperson read an invitation from the Standing Committee on Finance to a workshop on 19 September on the issue of monitoring the zero rating of agricultural inputs. &nbsp;He urged Committee members to be present at the workshop and apologised that she would not be present, as she would be attending a National Executive meeting.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Ramkhoase apologised for being absent at the workshop.</p>\r\n<p>The Chairperson announced that a joint workshop with Rural Development, Water and Sanitation had been approved. The Content Adviser said that contact had been made with some experts to make presentations.</p>\r\n<p>The meeting was adjourned.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The judgment had been handed down on 11 July 2013, so the Department had been instructed to remedy it and bring amending legislation that would be passed by 10 January 2015. A large number of operations involved in the training and exhibiting wild animals, as well as security dog companies, depended on annual licences to operate, so it was important that this amendment was processed in time.</p>\r\n<p>The time frame left was short, and the legislation had not yet been introduced.

The old Act had provided for the Committee to be on the panel to evaluate the nominees, whereas the amended Act gave the Minister the courtesy to invite the Committee to nominate. Three names and their curriculum vitae (CVs) had been submitted and the Committee had to recommend two names. She allowed the Committee five minutes to peruse the CVs and then asked for inputs from the Committee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr M Filtane (UDM) said that he was nominating Ms Sebina Hlapolosa because of her academic qualifications and the fact that she had no work contracts tying her down.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr C Maxegwana (ANC) seconded Mr Filtane&rsquo;s nomination.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs A Steyn (DA) said that she preferred Mr Isaac Bheki Mgidi.

He noted the written apologies from those members unable to attend.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Z Mandela (ANC) commented that the non-attendance of members for no concrete reason should be addressed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Acting Chairperson commented that this should be handled by the parties. The chief whip of a party must follow up. He then called for the briefing on the deregistration of Ncera Farms in preparation for the oversight visit scheduled for 23 September 2014.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>De-registration of Ncera Farms (Pty) Ltd: briefing</strong><br />\r\n\tMs Nokuzola Kakaza, Committee Content Advisor, gave the background on Ncera Farm as one of the entities of DAFF .It was originally Ncera Agricultural Development Corporation under EC Provincial Department of Agriculture but due to financial constraints, it was transferred to the former National Department of Agriculture (DoA) in 2004/05.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) was the sole shareholder of the entity, Ncera Farms, which covers 3 700 hectares. The mandate of Ncera Farms was to provide extension / mechanical services, training and agricultural support services to the farmers settled on Ncera farmland as well as the neighbouring communities.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNcera Farms (Pty) Ltd constituted Welcome Home Farm, where the Service Centre was located, and eleven state farms. Welcome Home Farm, located near East London, hosts the entity&rsquo;s Service Centre, office buildings, workshop and training rooms. It was approved in October 2004 and developed in 2005 to provide extension services, contract ploughing, training and technical advice to the ten farmers and surrounding communities. Agricultural activities include livestock and vegetable production. The eleven state farms covered approximately 2 200 of the 3 700 hectares. In 2005, the Department of Agriculture issued an advert looking for interested individuals to apply for the occupation and leasing of the state farms. After a selection process, 10 of the 11 farms were allocated to 10 successful applicants in 2007/08. The 11<sup>th</sup> farm, Rocklands, was not allocated and was reportedly reserved for settling ex-farm workers/dwellers. The 10 successful applicants were given PTOs (permission to occupy) with intention to provide them with three-year leases within a year, and option to buy at the end of the lease. However, since occupation, no leases or any other official documents were signed by the farmers except the 12-month PTOs. The tenth farmer reported that he pulled out of the process in 2008 after the Department failed to provide leases. Farmers reported that they never received any support from the Department and they lived on the farms with expired PTOs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe stakeholders and role players included ex-farm workers and surrounding communities. The Department of Agriculture never held any consultations with the former farm workers who also lived on the farms before the farms were allocated to new occupants. The farmers (10 successful applicants) were also never informed that the farms were occupied by former workers, who were also making use of the farm resources which created conflicts when the new farmers arrived to take occupation of the farms. The surrounding communities that fell under the two traditional authorities, the Imidushane (Jongilanga) Chieftaincy and the Phato Chieftaincy and other communities also laid claim to some of the farm land.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe challenges at Ncera Farms were identified as: conflicts among stakeholders &ndash; farmers and ex-farm workers; farm invasions; claims against Ncera from other stakeholders; lack of records for the establishment of entity; poor governance capacity at the entity; role of the caretaker (DAFF) and lack of monitoring and evaluation; entity not fulfilling its mandate and disregard for state farms and lack of response by DAFF to parliamentary recommendations and resolutions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome of the issues highlighted by the Fourth Parliament were around the forensic investigation that was conducted; the lack of records for Ncera, including criteria used to allocate the ten farms and how the funds were used since the entity&rsquo;s inception; the need for re-submission of Strategic Plans according to National Treasury guidelines and frameworks; a turnaround strategy; the proposed closure and deregistration of the entity; a plan providing alternative proposals had been expected in July 2013 and a progress report on deregistration had been expected in January 2014 from Ncera Farms.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Department claimed that it was having discussions with the Agricultural Research Council (ARC), the national Department of Rural Development and Land Reform (DRDLR), the Eastern Cape provincial Department of Rural Development and Agrarian Reform and Buffalo City Metro. No effort was made to resolve the conflict amongst stakeholders at Ncera. A reviewed turnaround strategy had not been submitted. The plan (and progress report) with alternative proposals on how to close or deregister Ncera was not submitted. There was no report-back on actions taken against government officials implicated in the forensic report.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIssues for consideration were:<br />\r\n\t\u25aa Progress in addressing matters highlighted in Forensic Investigation Report;<br />\r\n\t\u25aa Clarity and status of the 10<sup>th</sup> farm;<br />\r\n\t\u25aa Status of Rocklands Farm that was meant to settle ex-farm workers;<br />\r\n\t\u25aa Clarity and status of the unofficial arrangement between entity and Jongilanga Chieftaincy;<br />\r\n\t\u25aa Verification of claims against the entity;<br />\r\n\t\u25aa Detailed report of operations, staff complement and responsibilities, latest asset register<br />\r\n\t\u25aa Department to clarify its role as sole shareholder and caretaker.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong><em>Discussion</em></strong><br />\r\n\tMs Z Jongbloed (DA) wondered if the Committee had a way of holding the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) to account. The Committee had on several occasions requested reports from DAFF which were ignored. She asked if farming activities where taking place on the ten state farms apart from the Welcome Home farm. She asked for the situation report on the ex-farm workers/dwellers that were to be relocated to Rocklands. She commented that the arrangements with the Jongilanga community would be made known during the oversight visit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Nokozola Mgxoshe replied that there were activities on other occupied farms such as livestock rearing and cropping even though there was a continuous fight with the ex-farm workers. At the Welcome Home farm - the biggest part of the farm - the service centre was not in use. The ex-workers were currently still on the farm as they refused to move. Other dwellers had joined the invasion on the farm due to the &nbsp;high level of unemployment in the area as some depended on grants or remittances from migrants.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr B Joseph (EFF) commented that the Department had failed the people of the Eastern Cape as he did not know there were additional farms until the first briefing that was received from DAFF. He said there should be an agreement document on the management of the farm where guidelines were stated. If another department or entity took over the farm, if those ground rules were not in place on the use of the farm, there would still be deterrents. Measures should be put in place to ensure the success of the farm as it would be beneficial to the people of the Eastern Cape and the country as a whole. Farmers should be assisted to become big enterprises that could meet or challenge the existing big farmers&#39; association. He commented that the Committee must have its fact findings on its oversight visit to Ncera farms on what it intended to implement in terms of intervention.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Ramokhoase commented that the good intention of setting up the farm should not be missed as it was set up to change the lives of people through empowerment. The oversight visit should inform the Committee on the way forward for the farm. At the time the entity was set up, the two departments involved were not yet separated to deal with different mandates. This was an issue of land provision and land distribution which was not dealt with from the beginning hence the problem with the exclusion of some communities. No thorough research was done to plan for a proper Ncera farm. New Acts came with new dispensations likewise new bills and amendments came with new developments but the Ncera farm was never catered for in any Acts of the country as it was established on a temporary ad hoc arrangement. The role of the Act and legislation should be addressed. The role of the provincial legislature or government should also be considered as the state had failed because it should have been proactive in dealing with this and should have changed the development. These problems were identified but left unchanged. He required clarification on the responsibility of the department. The provincial legislature was not playing a meaningful role as it was expected to take charge of the factions, fighting and theft. He felt the provincial or local government should play this role. There was need to look at how best to implement a unitary state system on this situation as South Africa should remain a unitary state. He also commented on the deregistration that never materialized. There was no focus or concentration on the farm and deregistration had to be dealt with on the Committee&#39;s &nbsp;return from the oversight visit. The lack of political will should be addressed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Mgxashe replied that when Ncera was established, the Department of Agriculture and Department of Land Affairs were in one Ministry. Land Affairs acquired land while DAFF gave agricultural support. DAFF had always been involved with Ncera, including the allocation of the farm. However, Ncera was a national entity. The provincial legislature tried to intervene when they heard of the disputes amongst the people but the former CEO would not let them intervene, except the national department. The last Committee often involved the provincial legislature whenever it visited Ncera farms.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Mandela expressed concern about the many officials that moved from the one department to the other and requested clarity. He asked for the role of the traditional councils and the reason for creating an arm&#39;s length between two traditional councils. Change should be effected on the land dispute between the two communities. The Committee should give direction and ascertain what the department was doing in bringing about change and stability to the communities. Clarification was required on the arrangement made on the use of tribal land for cattle rearing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Mgxashe replied that it was formerly called the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Affairs and when it separated in 2009, many of the DAFF officials applied to the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform. She added that the Committee should find out about the role of the traditional council as the farms were previously commercial farms and the traditional councils were in the vicinity of the farms which had villages that fell under one traditional council. The Committee should find out about the arrangement and the use of Chief Jonjilanga&rsquo;s land for the entity&rsquo;s livestock to graze on it and the electricity bill. She commented on the instability in department management as the department had not had a permanent Director General / accounting officer since 2009 as they had all been in an acting position. The lack of records had contributed to the problems in the department as acting officials had no continuity to act upon.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr C Maxegwana (ANC), the Acting Chairperson, commented that an oversight visit was made to Ncera Farms by the Fourth Parliament and that oversight report would be useful to inform the Committee about what they did. No action could be taken without an oversight visit to the people. They needed to identify all the stakeholders involved in this dispute in order to effect immediate change. The Committee&#39;s decision would be informed by the findings from the visit on deregistration of the farm and what to do with the farm afterwards.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Mgxashe replied that the stakeholders had increased since the first visit by the Committee as the issue had been left unattended for too long by the Department and there was conflict among the stakeholders themselves, hence the Committee must find the stakeholders. She added that the main issue was the failure of the department to perform its duties and the capacity to work effectively.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs T Gasebonwe-Tongwane (ANC) commented that the intention for the formation of Ncera farms was a good one which was to develop and train people in agriculture but the farm was not used for the intended purpose. She felt the department officials contributed to the failure for not following up and wondered why no steps were taken even when advice was given to the department.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Acting Chairperson commented that there was need to communicate with the Portfolio Committee on Agriculture in the Eastern Cape as they also performed oversight. There should be an interaction with Portfolio Committees on Agriculture and Rural Reform in the Eastern Cape and other stakeholders.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Ramokhoase commented that parliamentary law advisors be tasked with the responsibility of locating a space for the establishment of an Act within the spectrum of legislation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Acting Chairperson noted the stakeholders that had been identified including the Eastern Cape legislature committee. The Committee needed an extra day at Ncera Farms in order to maximize the 22 September which was the day assigned for the oversight. The invasion of the area would have to be tracked.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Committee Minutes: adoption</strong><br />\r\n\tThe minutes of the 2 September 2014 were adopted. It was agreed that the delegates sent to represent the Committee at the Land Tenure Summit, would give a report on the Summit at the next meeting.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Nomination of candidates to serve on National Marketing Council (NAMC)</strong><br />\r\n\tMs Mgxashe reminded the Committee that the board of NAMC had two vacancies. The Portfolio Committee had received an invitation to nominate two candidates to serve on the board who had specific experience on the commercial production of agricultural products. Members were expected to encourage people with such a background to submit their curriculum vitae. The Committee would decide on two candidates or more then send the names to the Minister. The extended deadline for submission of CVs to the Minister was 12 September.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Acting Chairperson commented that the requirements for the candidates were clearly stated in the Act. The Committee had no curriculum vitae for that specification at the moment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Ramokhoase suggested that members should try to get curriculum vitae.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson commented that a quorum was needed for the nomination and asked members to suggest a suitable time to select the candidates. After discussion, it was agreed that a meeting be held at 1.30pm on Thursday, 11 September, for the finalisation of NAMC candidate nominations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Ntshayisa asked for the category of people to apply for the post.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson replied that people with the specified expertise within the country should be encouraged to apply.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Secretary announced that the Joint Policy Workshop with the Rural Development / Water and Sanitation would be held in Johannesburg. The Committee was in the process of submitting an application for political approval for 25-26 September.If approved it would be communicated to the committee members and the Select Committee on Land and Mineral Resources.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson thanked the members for their support and contribution.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe meeting was adjourned.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tApologies: Received from the Chairperson, Ms A Steyn (DA), Mr M Hlengwa (IFP) and Mr M Filtane (UDM) who had a committee meeting clash. There was no apology from Mr P Mabe (ANC).</p>\r\n",

        "summary": "<p>The Committee was briefed by its content advisor about the deregistration of Ncera Farms (Pty) Ltd in preparation for the Committee&#39;s oversight visit. The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) was the sole shareholder of the Ncera Farms. It was developed in 2005 to provide extension services, contract ploughing, training and technical advice to the ten farmers settled on the farmland and surrounding communities. The Department of Agriculture advertised for interested individuals to apply for the occupation and leasing of the state farms. After a selection process, 10 of the 11 farms were allocated to 10 successful applicants in 2007/08. The 11<sup>th</sup> farm, Rocklands, was not allocated and was reportedly reserved for settling ex-farm workers/dwellers. The 10 successful applicants were given PTOs (permission to occupy) with intention to provide them with three-year leases within a year, and option to buy at the end of the lease. However, since occupation, no leases or any other official documents were signed by the farmers except the 12-month PTOs. The tenth farmer reported that he pulled out of the process in 2008 after the Department failed to provide leases. The Department of Agriculture never held any consultations with the former farm workers who lived on the farms before the farms were allocated to the new occupants. The farmers (10 successful applicants) were also never informed that the farms were occupied by former workers, who were making use of the farm resources. This created conflicts when the new farmers arrived to take occupation of the farms. The surrounding communities fell under two traditional authorities. They and other communities also laid claim to some of the farm land.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChallenges at Ncera Farms were identified as: conflicts among stakeholders &ndash; farmers and ex-farm workers; farm invasions; claims against Ncera from other stakeholders; lack of records for the establishment of entity; poor governance capacity at the entity; role of DAFF as caretaker and its lack of monitoring and evaluation; entity not fulfilling its mandate and its disregard for state farms; and lack of response by DAFF to parliamentary recommendations and resolutions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIssues highlighted by the Fourth Parliament were around the forensic investigation that was conducted; the lack of records for Ncera, including criteria used to allocate the ten farms and how the funds were used since the entity&rsquo;s inception; the need for re-submission of Strategic Plans according to National Treasury guidelines and frameworks; a turnaround strategy; the proposed closure and deregistration of the entity; a plan providing alternative proposals had been expected in July 2013 and a progress report on deregistration had been expected in January 2014 from Ncera Farms.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe content advisor&nbsp; said that DAFF claimed that it was having discussions with the Agricultural Research Council (ARC), the national Department of Rural Development and Land Reform (DRDLR), the Eastern Cape provincial Department of Rural Development and Agrarian Reform and Buffalo City Metro. No effort had been made to resolve the conflict amongst stakeholders at Ncera. A reviewed turnaround strategy had not been submitted. The plan (and progress report) with alternative proposals on how to close or deregister Ncera had not been submitted. There had been no report-back on actions taken against government officials implicated in the forensic report.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIssues for consideration were:<br />\r\n\t\u25aa Progress in addressing matters highlighted in Forensic Investigation Report;<br />\r\n\t\u25aa Clarity and status of the 10<sup>th</sup> farm;<br />\r\n\t\u25aa Status of Rocklands Farm that was meant to settle ex-farm workers;<br />\r\n\t\u25aa Clarity and status of the unofficial arrangement between entity and Jongilanga Chieftaincy;<br />\r\n\t\u25aa Verification of claims against the entity;<br />\r\n\t\u25aa Detailed report of operations, staff complement and responsibilities, latest asset register<br />\r\n\t\u25aa Department to clarify its role as sole shareholder and caretaker.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Committee expressed concern over the ex-farm workers that were relocated to Rocklands and asked if farming activities were taking place on the other farms apart from the Welcome Home farm. There should be an agreement document on the management of the farm where guidelines were stated and small scale farmers should be assisted to become big enterprise farmers. The roles of the traditional council and provincial legislation in settling the disputes were required. The Committee expressed concern over about officials that moved from one department to another. Lack of political will needed to be addressed and the deregistration of Ncera needed to materialise after the oversight visit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Committee would finalise its candidates for the National Marketing Council at a meeting the next day.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "body": "<p><strong>Briefing by the Office of the Auditor-General of South Africa (AGSA)</strong><br />\r\n\tMs Meisie Nkau, Business Executive, AGSA, stated that the purpose of the session was to empower members and to enlighten them on AGSA&rsquo;s roles and products as stipulated in the Constitution. The role of oversight was to ensure that the citizens were well catered for, and it included to access and adjust; to identify the desired impacts; to set targets and allocate resources; to monitor and take corrective action. The objectives of the departments were informed by the mandate of the department and by identifying the desired impacts .The objectives must be approved with proper planning and there must be a budget to meet these objectives because for each specific performance indicator a target must be allocated. These performance indicators were established by the department hence the departments must perform proper budget planning and should be in a position to identify all the challenges that would hinder it from meeting these targets. The Portfolio Committee conducted in-year hearing through in-year reporting done on a quarterly basis by the department or entity on the performance and financial achievements. The department must be able to assure the Portfolio Committee that the information had gone through thorough checks and balances and was credible and complete. The Auditor General then audits the yearend report. The external audit in turn implements systems of internal control to prevent any omission, duplication or fraud. It was important for the internal control within a department or entity to be functional. Where the in-year monitoring was effective, there would be consequent assessments and adjustments to detect irregularities. Non-compliance in audit report would be because internal control failed the department/entity. When setting objectives and targets, there was need to identify areas where service delivery could take place and it had to be aligned to a budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBefore the start of a financial year, the department would present its Strategic Plan to the Portfolio Committee. The Portfolio Committee needed to access whether the objectives set were achievable, whether there was sufficient budget to meet the targets. The budget must align with the strategic plan and adequate resources should be allocated to priority areas. Implementing/monitoring was important to ensure that the departmental spending was on the right track and in line with strategic plan and priorities in order to prevent and detect fraud. Reporting kept management accountable and determined whether there was compliance with reporting responsibilities as set out in the PFMA and compliance with Parliament&rsquo;s Appropriation Act.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Combined assurance model was highlighted as the level of assurance that every party played in giving assurance in the outcome of the entity. It comprised of management assurance, oversight assurance and independent assurance. Management assurance was the first level of assurance as each level of management exercised assurance as the people within the entity because they were responsible for ensuring proper internal control, implementing effective system internal control, monitoring that it functioned effectively in order to provide credible and complete financial information. Management must be held accountable for this information and had to make sure there was effective leadership, effective financial management and effective governance. For oversight assurance, the coordinating treasury, internal audit and audit committee gave the 2<sup>nd</sup> level of assurance. The information that went to the Portfolio Committee must be credible hence oversight assurance would be able to support management information as credible and complete. The AGSA was committed to giving briefing to the Portfolio Committee before the committee compiled its BRRR. These briefing covered how to empower the committee to have effective hearing; update on progress of current year audits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe AGSA derives its mandate from Section 188 of the Constitution and from Section 20 of the Public Audit Act which provides that the Auditor &ndash;General must prepare audit reports containing opinions on financial statements and financial position, compliance and financial management and predetermined objectives. AGSA reports on financial statements and expresses an opinion on financial statements. It also audits performance information and expresses opinions in the management report of the entity and department. Compliance with rules and regulations focuses on regulations that had financial impacts. Findings in the audit report on compliance with rules and regulations had material deviations from legislation. The PFMA sets out the responsibilities of the accounting officer to keep proper record and to submit financial statements to the Auditor General. The AGSA may audit and report on the account, financial statements and financial management of all entities funded by the national revenue or provincial revenue fund or a municipal fund or any institution authorized by legislation to receive funds for public purposes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAGSA identified a number of areas where there were challenges and was committed to work with the public sector to achieve the following- transparent and stable reporting system (through daily, weekly and monthly reporting); budgeting and planning process through objectives and indicators that were aligned to the budget; focused information management platforms where internal audit and audit committee assured that credible and complete checks were done on information and that such information were credible and complete; Strong internal audit capabilities with internal control that were designed to monitor regularly that information given were credible and complete; Report to enable effective oversight&nbsp; as oversight was always focused on deficiency and inefficiency within the department; Applying consequences for transgressions and poor performance&nbsp; on repetitive findings. Consequences on poor performance could be training and development; Visible commitment by all players in the public service to ensure service delivery; demonstrated impeccable ethical behavior and professionalism seen in the risks in the supply chain; independent and relevant reporting by the AG needed to be relevant to our stakeholders; value-adding input expressed by the AG to enable oversight.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAGSA is accountable to the National Assembly and has to report on its activities and performance of its functions in terms of Section 10 of the Public Audit Act (PPA) in terms of its operation. There is a committee that oversees the AG in terms of its performance, finances and compliance. AGSA has predetermined objectives that are reported to Parliament, quarterly reports are represented to the committee in terms of its budget and performance.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWith regard to AGSA products, findings are raised as audit is carried out and AGSA indicates the root cause of the findings so management can take remedial measures. Regularity Audit is mandatory as it emanates from the Constitution and the Public Audit Act. AGSA&rsquo;s focus in terms of regularity audit is on financial statement, opinions, rules and regulations. Discretionary products come in form of Performance Audit which is different from Audit of Predetermined Objectives. Performance Audits are done on a focused area not the entity as a whole and is related to economic impact as it is critical to budget utilization. AGSA could also conduct an independent investigation where the need arose. Special Audits were agreed upon procedures such as donor funding certificates. AGSA provides assurance that financial statements are free from material misstatements, reported on usefulness and reliability of the information in the annual performance report, reported on material non-compliance with relevant laws and regulations and identified key internal control deficiencies to be addressed. However AGSA does not provide assurance that all applicable laws and regulations had been complied with, does not identify fraud and does not provide assurance that service delivery had been achieved.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Ebette Sekgetho, Manager, AGSA briefed the Committee further on the audit of financial statements and specific focus areas. Financial statements were required in terms of the Constitution and Public Audit Act. The auditor forms an opinion on whether the financial statements were prepared in all material aspects in accordance with the specific applicable financial reporting framework. An Audit of Predetermined Objectives covers audit on service delivery issues with focus on the reliability and usefulness of performance information and includes the measurement of targets as set in the beginning of the financial year which were actually achieved.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDifferent types of audit opinions includes- Unqualified audit opinion which is the financial statement that gives a true and fair view in accordance with the applicable financial report framework; Qualified audit opinion which means the effect of any disagreements with management from financial reporting framework or limitation on scope was not so material and persuasive; Disclaimer which means there was lack of supporting audit evidence to express an opinion; Adverse opinion which means the auditor disagreed with the representation made by management in the financial statements to the extent of confirming that it was not a fair reflection of the financial position, performance and cash flow. Annual report structures involved the report on the financial statements; reports on other legal and regulatory requirements; internal control (leadership, financial and performance management and Governance) and other reports (investigations, performance audits and agreed upon procedures)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Nkau further added that six areas had been identified to be impediments to unqualified/ clean audit opinions- material adjustment (daily checks), supply chain, predetermined objectives, IT control, HR management and financial health. There were five essential tools to a briefing process- the Annual report (including audit report and performance report); AGSA briefing notes; Accounting officer and audit committee&rsquo;s report; Estimates of National expenditures and State of the Nation Address/budget speeches.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFactors to ensure effective briefing process were highlighted as follows - Annual Reports by departments and entities must be reliable, accurate and complete. AGSA&rsquo;s review of annual reports was critical in ensuring complete, reliable and accurate reporting. Proper understanding of the mandate of entities by oversight committees must be ensured. AGSA briefing process must identify the root cause of audit outcomes. Recommendations by oversight committees must address the deficiencies identified by way of resolutions which must conform to SMART principles and these must be sent to executives for implementation. Action plans by entities and progress monitoring must address the deficiencies, must have deliverable milestones and also conform to SMART principles.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn conclusion, the presentation highlighted the performance of the DAFF and its entities over the last three financial years: the financially unqualified with no findings report reduced in the last three years from 29% (2010/11) to 14% in (2012/13). For the 2012/13 financial year, key control assessment reported were as follows-<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLeadership: management did not ensure that key functions (internal audit, regional offices) within the department were properly resourced and skilled.<br />\r\n\tFinancial management: there was a lack of monitoring and evaluation by senior management of the quarterly reporting as well as inadequate skills and procedures which resulted in material adjustment made to annual performance reports and financial statements across the portfolio. Non-compliance with legislation not prevented resulted in irregular expenditure.<br />\r\n\tGovernance: the department did not conduct a risk assessment as required; critical components within finance, performance information and compliance were not covered by the internal audit function due to inadequate resources and skills.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong><em>Discussion</em></strong><br />\r\n\tMs A Steyn (DA) thanked the AGSA for the presentation and said it was up to the Portfolio Committee to get to the bottom of some issues. Clarification was sought on how, when and who decides when performance audit investigation was initiated. How could a department have an unqualified opinion if there was a gap between the performance viz-a-viz compliance reported by the department as audit was carried out based on reports? She further sought clarity on what the helicopter view in audit reports meant.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Steyn asked how many findings must be available to move from an unqualified opinion to a qualified opinion. She commented that DAFF needed to employ internal auditors.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Nkau replied that helicopter view related to the general report which was the consolidation of the outcomes of the public sectors (an overview of outcomes in the public sector), for instance the total number of departments that had qualified or disclaimed findings. AGSA had a committee that was represented by the Business Executive Units which reviewed from some documents the hotspots for performance audit. AGSA previously relied on the departments to recommend areas of performance audit but it was found that departments were not keen on performance audits as it exposed the procurements and the use of resources. However if an audit committee member or the Portfolio Committee had a request on audit performance area, then the AG would be informed. Currently, the AGSA would propose to the department the focus area for performance audit. The AGSA had not performed investigations lately as it was focusing on performance audit and regularity audit. However if there were indications of fraud and corruption, AGSA management would be highlighted on the specific area. Requests from the Portfolio Committee could be sent to the Auditor General who would indicate whether AGSA was in the position to carry out the investigation or not.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr T Ramokhoase (ANC) questioned the impact of the relationship between the Auditor-General and the National Treasury on the department&rsquo;s accountability. Clarification was required on the reliability and accuracy of reports. Further explanation was requested on the findings done on material things and examples of material things as stated in the presentation.&nbsp; Clarification was sought on variance and deviations as some deviations happened under very extreme circumstances but it had been found that some departments deviated on regular basis. Details on the financial management inaccuracies in regional offices were requested.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Nkau replied that the materiality levels which were the acceptable error rates were determined when an audit was being carried out, as acceptable error rates were set for financial statements or performance information. As findings are rated and efficiency identified, where the department did not make adjustments, at the end it was aggregated. If below the materiality level, there would be no report, consequently if above the materiality level then it would be reported. The annual performance report of a department reports achievements with target indicators in terms of APP.&nbsp; AGSA then selects a sample of the achievements to verify if such achievements truly existed. The difference between targets and achievement was the variance. Another element of variance in terms of the financial report would be the identification of irregular expenditure which could be as a result of internal control deficiency. Deviation was more compliance driven which meant deviating from what regulations required or contrary to financial standards and practices.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Ramokhoase, interjecting, noted with concern that deviations with motivations were done in some departments and asked for explanation on why it was allowed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson replied that the PFMA allowed departments the right to deviate with reasons.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Nkau added that the PFMA allowed deviation with proof of reasons in emergency cases and it was also compliance driven.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Nkau stated that National Treasury had training initiatives on predetermined objectives and standard criteria that stated that for every target there must be an outcome. For a set outcome, evidence must be indicated to substantiate the outcome. The drive was now geared towards outcomes rather than the targets. After National treasury had evaluated the APP of departments, AGSA would still qualify when it audited hence both AGSA and National Treasury engaged the departments on trainings on how performance information was audited.&nbsp; APP reviews were done before the start of a financial year hence could only review usefulness with SMART principle. Reliability tests were done to validate the information achieved and accuracy of achievements.&nbsp; APP did not contain achievements hence there would not be reliability test on APP. In terms of reporting on performance information, the annual performance report of a department would indicate the targets, achievements and non-achievements. The AGSA audit report would state the findings as either reliable or unreliable. It was important that audit reports be read in conjunction with the annual performance report because if read in isolation the unqualified opinion on the performance report would give a false impression of achievements.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Sekgetho added that AGSA does not refer to the provincial offices .The deficiencies picked up were due to the accruals and commitment areas of the consolidated financial statements of the department. Many of the regional offices did not have the required skills and knowledge to account for accruals and commitments hence the skill deficiency reported in the presentation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr C Maxegwana (ANC) stated that more focus should be placed on service delivery not only on how government funds were used. A tightening on the use of funds was commendable but it was more important to consider the result delivered with such funds. An alignment between a clean way of handling books on finances and effectiveness to service delivery was desirable.&nbsp; Where there was a skills deficiency, departments at all levels should be assisted from all angles including the Auditor-General.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Nkau replied that in the APP there would be set targets for the department and AGSA&rsquo;s audit focused on targets that were set for the department. If a department spends outside the APP which was not budgeted for it should not form part of the reporting as it was not part of the mandate of the department. Issues around service delivery of things that were not budgeted for and were not in the APP would be taken back to the Office as it should be reported as an unauthorized expenditure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson noted that before departments submitted APPs to the Parliament, AGSA and Treasury must have accessed them, but often times the APP would have to be reevaluated by Parliament as some departments could not link target indicators to their budgets; there was need to look at how to balance some issues if all role players worked together. AGSA needed to take advantage of its relationship with Treasury as Treasury had the responsibility to capacitate departments in formulating these strategies and APP. Further explanation on SMART principle was requested.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Nkau replied that AGSA shared with the departments the criteria used to audit performance information by providing constant training and departments are measured on the same criteria. The AG audits on SMART principles to determine if super targets are time bound, measurable and achievable. There was no consequence management such that if people failed to deliver after attending these trainings, there should be consequences. The supervisor must be in a position to identify the problems.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson asked if government had a central audit committee and how it assisted the departments if there was, as the internal audits in the departments were not capacitated.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Nkau replied that in terms of legislation, two or three departments could have a combined audit committee. Currently, all departments had their audit Committee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Steyn asked if performance audit were reported in the Auditor-General&rsquo;s report.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Nkau responded that some standalone performance audits were carried out and reported and some were incorporated into AGSA regularity report. The standalone performance audits are tabled in Parliament and some findings are recorded in the regularity reports.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr M Filtane (UDM) highlighted that expenditure of the fiscal was not just about amount spent but the return on the investment on socioeconomic impact. He asked if the socioeconomic impact of the expenditure was central to AGSA&rsquo;s performance audit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Nkau commented that audits of predetermined objectives which represented service deliveries were incorporated in the regularity reports. National treasury had set criteria to measure the impact as the audit focused on the indicators of financial and social impacts. Through performance, audit procurement would be determined to have been done economically or effectively and utilization of the resources would be considered. Performance audit would be done on a focus area but focus tends to be more on the financial.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson thanked the AGSA for the presentation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Adoption of Committee Minutes</strong><br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson asked the committee members to review the minutes dated 29 July 2014.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Steyn moved for the adoption of the minute as it was a true reflection of what was discussed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Z Mandela (ANC) seconded the adoption.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Steyn requested that the Secretary followed up with the other documents and reports from the department on a regular basis.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson commented that efforts were made to ensure that members got the necessary documents in time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Tabling and Consideration of the invitation from the Minister to nominate candidates to serve on NAMC</strong><br />\r\n\tMs Nokuzola Mgxashe, Content Adviser: Parliament commented that the process was the same as with the ARC, the board of NAMC had two vacancies and the Committee had received a letter from the Minister to send two nominations. People would be approached to submit their curriculum vitae to the Committee and the Committee would select two names that would be forwarded to the Minister on the 12<sup>th</sup> September. Copies of the Marketing of Agricultural Products Act number 47 of 1996 Section 4.2 had been circulated for the requirement for the nominees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson asked if the Committee could nominate more than two.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Mgxashe replied that the Committee could send more than two names as the Minister would decide on the final selection.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr S Mncwabe (NFP) asked if the people to be approached should be outside the House or among the Committee members.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson replied that it was open to South Africans in general. Members would collect CVs which would be reviewed and accessed for selection.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe committee discussed other internal arrangements with regard to its schedule and a suitable time for oversight duties.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe meeting was adjourned.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "summary": "<p>The AGSA briefed the Committee on the roles of AGSA as directed by the Constitution and the Public Audit Act in order to empower and build capacity of Members for oversight duties. The role and importance of oversight were highlighted in the course of the presentation, as well as the Parliamentary processes leading up to the AGSA&rsquo;s reports.&nbsp; Before the start of a financial year, the department presents its Strategic Plan to the Portfolio Committee. The Portfolio Committee needs to determine whether the objectives set were achievable, whether there was sufficient budget to meet the targets etc. Budget preparation must align with the strategic plan and adequate resources should be allocated to priority areas. Implementing/monitoring was important to ensure that the departmental spending was on the right track and in line with strategic plan priorities in order to prevent and detect fraud. Reporting kept management accountable and determined whether there was compliance with reporting responsibilities as set out in the PFMA and compliance with Parliament&rsquo;s Appropriation Act.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Combined assurance model was highlighted as the level of assurance that every party played in giving assurance in the outcome of the entity. It comprised of management assurance, oversight assurance and independent assurance. AGSA&rsquo;s contributions to oversight were highlighted. AGSA was committed to briefing the Portfolio Committee before the committee compiled their BRRR .These briefing generally covered empowering the committee to have effective hearing; update on progress of current year audits. The work done by AGSA included providing assurance that the annual financial statement was free from material misstatements; reporting on usefulness and reliability of the information in the annual performance report and identifying key internal control deficiencies to be addressed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Committee expressed concern about the performance audit as it was fiscally centered rather than focused on socioeconomic impact and service delivery. The Committee asked how performance audits investigations were carried out and whether the departments had internal auditors. Explanation was requested on unqualified opinions and SMART principle. The working relationship between National Treasury and AGSA was questioned. Clarifications were required on materiality finding, variance and deviations. The balance between fund utilization and service delivery was reiterated.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Committee tabled and considered the invitation from the Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries to nominate candidates to serve on the National Agriculture Marketing Council (NAMC). Members were asked to approach people for their curriculum vitae which would be reviewed for selection of two nominees.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "body": "<p>The committee researcher said that sixteen out of 53 indicators had been achieved in the third quarter and nineteen out of 53 in the fourth. This translated into 30% and 33% respectively, while the entire budget for these two quarters had been spent, even though the intended objectives had not been met. Nothing had been reported on the 24 Acts that should have been processed. Programme 5 does not stipulate where the 200 000 hectares that have been rehabilitated are located, so one cannot assess whether provincial targets were achieved. While performance was low, budget expenditure was virtually 100% at 98%. This was a standing issue, reoccurring in previous years that pre-determined objectives could not be met. In Programme 2 spending stood at 82%, which should have been closer to 75%, in the form of transferred funds to provinces and agencies and accounts. According to expenditure of National Treasury only 70% was transferred to provinces and agencies. There was a discrepancy. In Programme 5 only 55% of the budget had been spent by the third quarter. While this programme had been previously underfunded, it seemed the Department still struggled to spend the budget here, which was apparently due to capacity problems. Funds had been transferred between programmes from programmes 2,4 and 5 to programmes 1, 3 and 6 to the amount of R42,9 million. Much had moved from service delivery to administration. This was worrying. Usually performance picked up during the year, but in this case, percentages had dropped in the third and fourth quarters. While the Pig Improvement Scheme was a success, the scheme seemed to have been cancelled. In Programme 3 the target support for subsistence farmers had been achieved but not that for small scale farmers. Out of 90 000 only 3000 could be verified. What did this support consist of and since no detail was provided it could even lead to double counting, whereby the same farmers could be receiving different kinds of support. These figures all needed clarifying. The task of job creation in line with the National Growth Path was not achieved. Lack of funding was given as a reason for this. What had happened to the funds retracted by National Treasury? The slow progress in the implementation of the agro-processing strategy was a concern.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnother researcher, Mr Joseph Ginindza, spoke on fisheries. He said the stated achievements were not a reflection of targets set. For example, the review of the Marine Living Resources Amendment Bill was actually completed in the first quarter of 2014. Out of 8 targets for Fisheries, only two had been achieved by the third quarter. Yet this was considered to constitute 92% of the annual target which simply did not compute. Fishing rights had been nullified by the previous Minister and needed to be revised. The Department had done well in its support to farmers regarding aquaculture. Abalone poaching remained a challenge and the Department needed to brief the Committee, possibly in a closed meeting, on how it was going to combat organised crime.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong><em>Discussion </em><br />\r\n\tCommittee researcher briefing </strong><br />\r\n\tMr L Ntshayisa (AIC) asked why if there was an unemployment problem in the country, was capacity an issue and if only 70% of funds had been transferred to the provinces, what had happened to the rest of the funds?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs A Steyn (DA) queried the positive trade balance, which was indicated as having increased from R3,1 billion in 2012 to R15,1 billion in 2013, which although seeming to be a great improvement, did not detail the breakdown between imports and exports. It was her understanding that imports had increased more than exports. She wanted to know what these figures constituted.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Z Jongbloed (DA) wanted to know what the latest situation was regarding abalone rights which were set to expire at the end of July.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr T Ramokhoase (ANC) asked how the department would be responding to the Auditor-General&rsquo;s findings.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Maxhegwana (ANC) referred to slide 6 of the presentation which list achievements and asked for a breakdown of the number of mobile animal clinics according to province.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe researcher replied that according to the PFMA, overspending had occurred on Programme 2 and that targets and spending should be spread roughly equally over the four and therefore there should be about 25% spending occurring in the first quarter and by the third quarter, spending should stand at around 75% accumulatively. This spending should go hand in hand with achieved deliverables. There was an anomaly between what had been spent on Programme 2 and the non achievement of deliverables. Programme 5 had been previously underfunded and yet when it had been allocated additional funding, only 55% of the budget had been spent by the third quarter and targets had not been achieved. The categorization of agricultural produce versus food products was not clear in the department document. It was not clear whether South Africa was still a net importer of food products. Food security was a major concern as also highlighted by National Treasury. Relying on food imports should be avoided if possible, for example maize produce should be processed in South Africa as well. It seemed that concerns raised by the Auditor-General persisted and no visible plans were in place to address them. A concern about compulsory community service by para-vet and veterinary students through the mobile clinics, was that these students should be adequately equipped to do their work.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Minutes</strong><br />\r\n\tMinister Senzeni Zokwana took the Committee through the performance expenditure reports and at various points where underachievement was indicated, the Minister acknowledged room for improvement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe said the Citrus Black Spot (CBS) issue was being dealt with in conjunction with the Ministry of Science and Technology. Regarding fresh ostrich meat, other markets continued to buy from South Africa. Problems around infrastructure and curriculum at certain colleges was being addressed and R65 million had been made available to address them. While the Knowledge and Information Management (KIM) Strategy had not been implemented, fast tracking of change management plan was underway. Due to the elections, the legislation review had been delayed. The Agro-processing Strategy not implemented due to poor leadership in the Branch. The drought had affected their ability to provide support to small growers in KZN.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tProfessor Edith Vries, DAFF Director General, spoke to annual targets and milestones achieved in the third and fourth quarters. There were some instances where there were several milestones for each target. In Annexure E of the Annual Report, more detail was provided on support given to small scale farmers. She noted there was a weakness in the system of performance monitoring. In total, 69% of the milestones had been achieved by the end of the third quarter and 84% by the end of the fourth. The Auditor General had given an unqualified opinion on financial information. This required at least 80% achievement. It had assessed three of the programmes; 2, 3 and 5. Programme 2 moved from a qualification to an unqualified opinion. Food Security and Agrarian Reform remained qualified. Forestry Management moved from a disclaimer to a qualification.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe CFO of the Department summarized the expenditure of the Department:<br />\r\n\tOut of a budget of R6,1 billion, expenditure during the third quarter was slightly above the 25% at 26, 9%, and while being at 25% for the fourth quarter. R3,98 million was spent during the third quarter on employees salaries and R3,81 million in the fourth quarter. Transfers and subsidies totalled R1, 017 billion during the third quarter and R801 million during the fourth quarter. Reasons for over spending or under-spending were provided.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAreas of concern raised by the Auditor General and action taken by DAFF were listed:<br />\r\n\t\u25aa Performance Monitoring has improved. However, the impact of these measures will only be evident at the end of 2014/15.<br />\r\n\t\u25aa Problems in Risk Management and Internal Audit were raised as matters of concern. However, it has been corrected and will not present as a repeat finding.<br />\r\n\t\u25aa Irregular expenditure was identified but disciplinary action was instituted.<br />\r\n\t\u25aa Inadequate monitoring of conditional grants such as CASP. Evaluation had been done by the Department of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation.<br />\r\n\tA Draft Report on this and the plan for corrective action was still being finalised.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong><em>Discussion</em></strong><br />\r\n\tMs Steyn (DA) thanked the delegates for the presentation and commented that in general throughout the presentation, one could not get a sense of what percentage of the target had been achieved and what original targets had been set. For example where it mentioned the number of hectares rehabilitated, there was no indication what percentage of the total area this rehabilitation constituted, in order to get a sense of what had really been achieved and what still needed to be done. She felt that while some activities had been categorized as achievements in the presentation, she was hard put to consider them as achievements, since they made very little impact on the sector as a whole. She would be submitting written questions in this regard. She asked for more detail on what imports and exports consisted of in order to get a more realistic perspective on the positive trade balance figures. Similarly, when it came to the Animal Production and Health Programme, there was no detail on what was being measured as a target. She wanted to know whether the Pig improvement scheme had been cancelled. Regarding Inspection and Quarantine Services, comments did not indicate whether targets had been achieved, merely that regular inspections had been conducted. She asked for assurance around capacity to deal with the regulations from the EU in controlling the Citrus Black Spot disease. She asked if the upgrades which had been due for Potchefstroom College had been completed since the institution had fallen into a state of disrepair. Had the funding which had been taken back by National Treasury for the Agri BEE fund, been returned yet? The amount in question was around R230 million. Where were the negotiations with Landbank in this regard? The report on 15 cooperatives being supported did not instil any confidence, since this was a paltry number in the context of a country like South Africa. Also no further details on how much had been spent and how these cooperatives had been supported, had been provided.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Z Mandela (ANC) said he had yet to see the Department&rsquo;s involvement in delivering towards the food security&nbsp; of rural communities in line with the comprehensive rural development programme. In his home community some 352 ha had been fenced by the Department of Rural Development but various challenges still remained, such as irrigation and stock such as cattle, goats and donkeys. There seemed to be some Chinese involvement, since they were interested in donkey products. How was the Department getting involved in partnership with the Department of Rural Development? He asked why the Department seemed to be focusing only on the EU in exporting citrus. What about the BRICS countries? What was the Department doing about changing traditional ways for keeping and selling stock? What was the Department doing about encouraging primary and high school learners to become more interested in working in the agricultural sector? Is land being made available for this purpose and are household gardens being actively promoted? He asked how it was possible that 0 hectares had been revitalized at Makhathini. Under the Food Security Programme, he wanted to know where the subsistence producers were located that had been supported and how these had been selected.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr T Ramokhoase (ANC) commented that relevant information was needed in order to acquit the task of oversight properly. Also he wanted to know which issues, if any, had been raised when the Auditor General issued his unqualified audit report. How would these issues be addressed?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Steyn said that the report had not covered all work done by the Department and that she would like to raise the question of problems that had been reported to her around Act 17 on subdivisions and Act 36 regarding registrations. Major backlogs had been reported in these areas. The previous minister had even been taken to court over some of these issues. The Minister could decide if he wanted to answer these questions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Semenya agreed that it was the right of parliament to include such matters but that this should be done in good time, and not squeeze it in without proper notice.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr B Joseph (EFF) said targets were not clear in the report. The previous year&rsquo;s Annual Performance Plan (APP) was difficult to get hold of and evidence should be produced to warrant an expenditure of 98,9%. If the vacancy rate was 9,5% , which was considered average, how could it be that budget expenditure reached 98,9%. There was a discrepancy, since according to these number approximately 90,5% of the budget should have been spent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Semenya asked for comment on how the Department reconciled the dilemma of not having filled all posts and at the same time was struggling to find funds for service delivery?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tProf Vries, Director General for the Department, agreed that not all the work of the Department was reflected in the reports and that only what was considered strategic matters had been included based on the MTSF targets and issues raised by the Auditor General. On the unqualified report by the latter, there had been no matters of emphasis, merely concerns raised as listed in the report and an audit action plan had been drafted to tackle them. In order to ensure that these issues would not come up again, it had been resolved to reduce these issues by 60% before the next year&rsquo;s audit. The evidence requested on what was being measured in targets and how these were being monitored, was detailed in Annexure E of the annual report. The vacancy rate was partly due to the length of time it took to have applicants qualifications checked through SAQA and to obtain their security clearance, which took 5.8 months. Once a position was vacated, it was not simply a matter of filling it again, as the nature and demands of the position were constantly changing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tProf Vries confirmed that the funding retracted by National Treasury for the Agri BEE fund had not yet been returned. A meeting with the CEO of Landbank, together with the Directors General of National Treasury and Rural Development. The Department was guided by the National Development Plan, the Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP) in the same way as the Department for Rural Development, as well as by the Mozambique Declaration, which stipulated 10% of public expenditure should be on agriculture. In many ways the mandates for both Departments overlapped, causing both to fight over the same funds for essentially the same purposes. There was confusion around each Department&rsquo;s mandate with the Department of Rural Development increasingly getting involved in agriculture. It was important to foster collaboration between the Directors General as seven out of nine HODs report to both.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Minister said the Department was committed to facilitating oversight by the Committee and welcomed any written enquiries. On the questions raised by Mr Ramokhoase, he agreed that actions taken to address concerns raised by the AG would have to be monitored and time frames set for their resolution. On the question on service delivery versus posts being filled, he said that performance would have to be better monitored and analysed going forward.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeneral Bheki Cele, Deputy Minister, said that service delivery was always a moving target and that filling posts affected service delivery. Finding people with the right qualifications remained a challenge, but should not lead to compromises just for the sake of filling a position.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Moketsa Ramasodi, (Acting) DDG: Agricultural Production, Health &amp; Food Safety, confirmed that targets had been achieved in the Inspection and Quarantine Services Programme and regular inspections being conducted. The focus had been shifted from the National Pigs survey to avian influenza surveillance. Additional manpower for the monitoring of Citrus Black Spot had been arranged through reprioritizing and also capacity for research in this area was available. Diversification of the citrus market was on the cards and did involve certain BRICS countries as 40% of citrus was being exported to the EU. A service delivery plan was in place to fill vacancies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Minister said that meetings with citrus growers along with the Department of Science and Technology were taking place to manage the demands made by the EU regarding Citrus Black Spot (CBS) disease, although some of these were not so much about South African deficiencies but rather about protecting European farming interests. He was sure that these challenges would be overcome. Kaonafatso ya Dikgomo needed more work and implementation in the rural areas. Issues such as where to sell one&rsquo;s cattle optimally needed to be addressed by municipalities and traditional leaders with buy-in from all stakeholders.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Semenya said there was little evidence of Kaonafatso ya Dikgomo in some provinces and support was not consistent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Ramasodi said the deliverables for the interbreeding programme had not been achieved and interbreeding between the Namaqua goat and the Afrikaner cattle had not succeeded. This was due to late procurement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Maxhegwana asked for an audit of the Tsolo and Potchefstroom Colleges. He asked what would happen to the balance of the 1 988 students who had been trained but not placed in positions, which were 599.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Steyn asked for more context on the information on the revitalization of the Vaal irrigation schemes. It was meaningless without understanding how long the entire project would take to complete and also in determining whether this was really realistic and acceptable.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Mokutule Kgobokoe, Deputy Director General: Food Security and Agrarian Reform (FSAR), said that Potschefstroom College had been upgraded since some R4,5 million had been transferred from National Treasury and had been accredited by the Council on Higher Education. There was a career awareness programme run by the Department as well as a Agricultural Bursay Scheme to attract youth into the sector, although more needed to be done. This in turn would require more resources. Currently they had a system where primary school learners were identified and captured in high school up to matric. Typically these matric learners would have both maths and science as subjects. They could then qualify for bursaries. On the Makhatini question, this must be a mistake since work had been done on this project although not necessarily completed. Support was based on recommendation from district committees and in turn recommended by provincial committees. Information on these selections could be provided to the Committee. The suggestion to audit both Tsolo and Potchefstroom Colleges was noted. The Fetsa Tlala initiative for 2013/14 was to place 200 000 ha under production, of which about 149 000 ha was achieved. The shortfall was due to budget constraints.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Minister admitted that the colleges should be audited. A food production meeting with the MECs had emphasized the need for a seamless model running though national to local levels. New technology needed to be brought in and unused land needed to be harnessed. Diversification of crops was vital as many farmers sill focused on one crop. Processing such crops was also important.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDeputy Minister Cele said that in promoting agriculture in education, the practical aspect of this skill needed to be incorporated rather than just theory as seemed to be the case at certain schools where learners could take the subject to matric level. Tighter control needed to be maintained on the grant system, which at a cost of some R2 billion was substantial and the Department needed to see results from this investment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Semenya acknowledged the improvements that had been facilitated by the Minister and his Deputy, but that transformation was still required at certain educational institutions. The Fetsa Tlala initiative needed to be explained to the Committee as there seemed to be some inequalities in the implementation of the scheme. Some farmers seemed to be long term recipients of the scheme, while some complained that the costs had outweighed the benefits. Eskom also needed to be engaged in this project.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Minister said further analysis was needed on these allocations made in the past and province needed to account for them. Operation Phakisa was part of this process of accountability. He agreed that where the Department funded educational institutions, it should have the right to require transformation. Youth needed to be enticed into this lucrative sector and alternative energy sources should also be harnessed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Jongbloed asked for more information to be supplied to the Committee on the AgriBEE Fund since most of the committee members were new.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Ramokhoase said that that the Department had twelve months to determine the success or failure of a project and that measures needed to be put in place during that period to ensure a turn around. Simply giving &ldquo;slow progress&rdquo; as a reason was unacceptable. This referred particularly to the CAADP.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Mandela said there was little support for indigenous communities in the forestry sector. The Department should empower rather than provide handouts. He questioned the Department&rsquo;s ability to increase irrigation schemes when they seemed to be struggling to maintain those already in existence. He referred in particular to the Mvezo and Ncamata Basin Schemes. He questioned whether South Africa had the capacity to police its coastal waters as large parts of it were being occupied by foreign ships who were obviously poaching. Surely local communities should be supported to be able to start benefiting from maritime resources, rather than foreigners. How was this being facilitated?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Steyn pointed out that our farmers needed more support and protection. The report had clustered information on forestry which needed clarification. Land claims from forestry had not been transferred to communities yet.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Jongbloed said rights for abalone expired on 31 July. What was the Department doing about it? Was the Fishing Rights Allocation Process (FRAP) being revised? She asked whether the Afrikaner was still under repair.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Semenya questioned whether it was still worth repairing the Afrikaner, which was very old.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Minister confirmed that this one vessel was still in repair. Cracks had been found round the engine. The sea shore needed to be made more secure. Various projects, even ship building projects had been considered in this context in the third workstream of Operation Phakisa&nbsp; in conjunction with other departments. We needed to retain the use of our resources. Abalone rights could not simply be banned or one would encourage poaching. Law advisors were working on this question currently. FRAP would transform the fishing industry since it was not acceptable for a few companies to be in a position to exploit our resources.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDeputy Minister Cele said the decision around abalone rights was in process. The population needed to be socialized around seafood consumption as a whole as many blacks did not consider it a viable food source yet. This perception was changing slowly.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Minister said that all communities living around forests should benefit and they were engaging various local authorities in this regard. They would also be visiting kings in the Eastern Cape to discuss the protection and harvesting of maritime resources. The land claimed in KZN in the Nquthu local authority will be transferred.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Mortimer Mannya, DDG: Fisheries, said that the decline in fish socks was indicated by the decrease in 1991 from 615 tonnes to 46 tonnes in 1996. Abalone was a high value species and therefore a transformation programme was urgently needed to curb temptation to poach.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Semenya thanked the Minister and delegation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Committee matters </strong><br />\r\n\tLooking at the draft programme, Ms Semenya suggested the Committee take five days in September to do oversight.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Steyn agreed but suggested the committee decide on the itinerary, to ensure these trips were better planned and more effective.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Maxhegwana suggested an advance party ensure a more productive outcome.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Semenya agreed that research needed to be done in this regard and that the visits cover all aspects equally, agriculture, forestry and fisheries.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Committee adopted minutes of a previous meeting.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe meeting was adjourned.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "summary": "<p>The Committee was briefed by the Committee researchers before the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries presented their third and fourth quarter performance reports for 2013/14. Minister Zokwana presented the report, covering achievements and so-called non-achievements. Some of the achievements were the positive trade balance, successive unqualified audit opinions, and regulatory measures applied to identify Citrus Black Spot (CBS) orchards to ensure continued exports of citrus to the EU.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome of the non-achievements related to a weakness in monitoring results, the lack of success in the conservation project of a number of indigenous agricultural genetic resources. Out of a total of 130 000 subsistence producers only 36 678 were supported. Evidence from provinces for performance was inconsistent. National Department also failed in verifying the evidence against the information provided. The Department had made little progress in implementing the Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP) and the implementation of the Charter undertakings in Forestry Development and regulations. The allocation of fishing rights needed urgent attention and finalisation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Department operates six programmes:<br />\r\n\tProgramme 1- Administration<br />\r\n\tProgramme 2 &ndash; Agricultural Production, Health and Food Safety<br />\r\n\tProgramme 3 &ndash; Food Security and Agrarian reform<br />\r\n\tProgramme 4: Economic Development, Trade and Marketing<br />\r\n\tProgramme 5 : Forestry and Natural Resources Management<br />\r\n\tProgramme 6: Fisheries Management<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMembers raised concerns about the state of educational institutions, the high expenditure versus low target achievement in certain programmes, the abalone rights that were about to expire at the end of July, lack of clarity in the report on matters such as support and regional distribution of such support. Concern was raised around the vulnerability of marine resources and slow progress in revamping of irrigation schemes. The Department acknowledged these concerns, inviting further enquiries and assuring ongoing endeavours to make improvements where necessary.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

That way, Members would be better informed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr C Maxegwana (ANC) advised Ms Jongbloed that it was important to have an understanding of the background. &nbsp;&nbsp;The department had said that they wanted to boost farming and fishing, so these became the driver of the plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr B Joseph (EFF) asked what financial year the report was referring to. He also asked how the committee created synergy in terms of the fishing rights and the quotas. He highlighted that in July, the committee would discuss the third and fourth quarters, which was why he was seeking clarity on which quarters they were referring to.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson said that the policy would elaborate how the Department would empower small-scale farmers. With regards to the fishing nights, the Minister confirmed them, but now he is in court. She said that empowering the disadvantaged could not be wrong.&nbsp; Perhaps it was the manner in which it was done. She said that quarters (for reporting) were not important; rather it was the process that was important. They were talking about policy that would evaluate the Department on its inclusive programme.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Content Advisor said that the allocations ended on 31 December, so if the Department did their allocations late, they would be out of the cycle and they could be taken to court. Thus it helps the Department to implement the allocations early so that companies had no cause to blame the government. &nbsp;This was the same concern that Mr Joseph was also voicing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Ramokhoase then suggested that they immediately establish a deadline, so that whatever arose in future, the Committee would know that it is protected.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson said that they wanted to see implementation of the policy. Thus they expect the Department to implement it in order to accommodate the allocation rights that were lapsing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Content Advisor added that in the Amendment to the Act, there were different times for different species of fisheries. They were finalising the implementation plan for policy. &nbsp;The Committee could prescribe that the Department implement on a specific date.&nbsp; That should be added under recommendations, or they could call the Department to the Committee to speak to them about it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson acknowledged that there had been a monopoly and that they needed to bring in small-scale farmers. This would be done by either giving rights to small-scale farmers or by encouraging bigger farmers to include and incorporate the small farmers into their business. The allocation of rights could have a major effect. She agreed that Mr Joseph was right and that a deadline needed to be put in place. She called for Members to speak about whether they wanted to implement a deadline this year, and if so, they needed to consider the issue of the allocation rights passage closing in December.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs V Mogotsi (ANC) proposed that they delayed this to the next financial year in order to give time to deal with the allocation of rights.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Jongbloed agreed with Ms Mogotsi, but asked to be briefed as to how it would be implemented.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson replied that there was a detailed plan which the Department had, and Ms Jongbloed should read it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Content Advisor said that the Department had indicated they would implement in this financial year, by the end of March 2015.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson clarified that the Committee was not telling the Department not to implement or to wait for implementation, but rather was telling them that by the end of the next financial year, the Department needed to have completed the implementation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Filtane questioned how they would know when the Department did it?&nbsp; An updating date should be set up.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Ramokhoase suggested that the updating date be scheduled for the last quarter report.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Joseph said that the EFF could not agree to the closing down of the farms mentioned in the recommendations, because the impact of its closure.&nbsp; There needed to be another look at the reasons.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson clarified that it was not the closure of the project, but rather the deregistration of Ncera Farms as an entity. They were not closing and killing it. It had been given budget just for paying staff members and now it needed to be transferred to another entity to run and operate. When something was registered, it needed to be funded, but the R3 million being spent was too costly. If it was for the community, it would be a different story.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Maxegwana highlighted that they had already looked at the report and the recommendations about this, and it was the de-registration and transferring that would continue to empower the people. He suggested that the Committee go to the Eastern Cape and have a look at Nqirha so everyone would know what they were talking about. &nbsp;&nbsp;All agreed with the proposal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Joseph agreed as well, but was still sticking to his stance of not agreeing to its closure. &nbsp;He said that according to what had been discussed at the meeting on 8 July and what he had read in the minutes, it spoke about closing it down, and he disagreed with this.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChairperson confirmed that the minutes and report would then need to be edited, and they needed to say &lsquo;deregistered&rsquo; and not &lsquo;closed down&rsquo;.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Joseph then requested that he be provided with some background information.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChairperson agreed that this was fair and noted it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tMr Filtane said that after the Minister&rsquo;s presentation, he had mentioned that some companies give less regard to government plans of enabling people to also enter the forestry industry. &nbsp;In the Eastern Cape, there was a lot of land for forestry but the Department did not allow the communities to have the opportunity to use that land. He thus wanted to lobby the support of the Committee to make the Department put a focus on this issue.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson clarified that the Charter already stated all that Mr Filtane was saying, so as the committee, they should rather put pressure on the Department to implement the Charter, and this could be to added on to the recommendations.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Regarding management and disease control, the Chairperson said that the Department should be providing veterinary services that were needed. &nbsp;In rural areas, there is no awareness and support regarding these issues. Although the Department has launched some mobile clinics in rural areas, they are not enough, as people are not even aware of them.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n\tMr Filtane agreed on this.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson then called for a proposal to adopt the report.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Ramokhoase proposed that the report be adopted, with recommendations and amendments.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Jongbloed said that she and the DA reserved the right to not adopt the report until they had had an opportunity to discuss the report with the caucus of the DA.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson replied that she understood political affiliations, but everyone had been given time to go through and examine the report before the meeting. She suggested that they go through the rules to clarify whether or not what Ms Jongbloed was suggesting was even allowed. This was not a debate of the House, but a report of the Committee. All this time, Ms Jongbloed had not said anything. She told Ms Jongbloed that she could differ only on content, and nothing else. She added that it would have been helpful if Ms Jongbloed had taken time to do what she was requesting before the meeting and brought a report about what she and her political affiliates were not satisfied with in the report.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Filtane suggested that the Chairperson consider a date where she could provide a workshop for all the Members of the Committee so everyone could know how to address certain issues.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson replied that there was an induction workshop for Members, and everyone took an oath as individual members. She repeated that this was a committee meeting, and that there would an opportunity in the House where all parties would debate and, as a party, they could say if they did not support a particular document or budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Maxegwana also told Ms Jongbloed that he understood that everyone in the room was from a different political party.&nbsp; He suggested that she should have first touched base with her party and only then come to the meeting.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Joseph highlighted that this was a rather sensitive matter and that everyone needed to understand that they ought to build a community as the committee, on the understanding that they were all fighting a common cause. It should be put down on record that he and the EFF, although they agreed on some aspects, did not agree with some of the recommendations because the recommendations still do not address that Ncera should not be closed down.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson acknowledged Mr Joseph&rsquo;s objection to the report and said that it was valid, because they knew exactly what it was that they were supposed to do, whereas the DA had no particular objection to it and yet they had decided that they were against the report too.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Jongbloed then went on to highlight three important issues which she had with the report that were causing her to not support it. The three issues were:<br />\r\n\t-&nbsp; Budget allocations for fisheries were not sufficient.</p>\r\n<p>-&nbsp; More money needed to be put in anti-poaching initiatives and compliance.<br />\r\n\t-&nbsp; There should be la greater focus on promoting small scale farming.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson clarified that the Committee had already agreed that there was not enough of a budget allocation for the Department as a whole and had recommended that Department make a case to the Treasury that Agriculture should be given 10% of the National Budget.<br />\r\n\tShe then moved on to say that the Minister had launched Operation Phakisa, which was a government initiative and not necessarily a Department initiative.&nbsp; Operation Phakisa focussed on preserving and looking after natural minerals and resources. The Department of Agriculture could not arrest anyone; they needed to work with the security cluster. So the Department could not say that nothing was being done as there was a programme involving other departments as well. The had President said in the State of the Nation Address that there would be a focus on the seas, as they had not yet tapped into the potential of the sea to generate income and livelihood for people.<br />\r\n\tShe then asked if they could move on to the adoption of the minutes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Joseph said that he did not have a problem with the content per say, but he realised that there were key questions and dialogue which had taken place during the meeting which had not been reflected in the minutes. He expressed the fear that if someone who knew the industry tooka look at these minutes, they would think that the Committee was not doing anything.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson replied that the meetings of Parliament are voice recorded and thus minutes are just a summary. If someone would like to have more detail, they should rather listen to the recordings.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Secretary noted that not all venues had voice recording devices. She also said that the format of the minutes was the format which all committees used.&nbsp; They used to have a much more extensive form of the minutes, but they had been instructed to keep them as short and concise as possible.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson requested that in future, only venues with recording devices be used.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Joseph then proposed that they highlight key issues of discussions in the minutes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson agreed that the key issues had been summarised too much. They needed to give a little bit more detail as to what had been spoken about and what the resolutions were.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Filtane added that the minutes reflected only that there had been a presentation, and they did not give any information about the discussions, and this was not fair.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson agreed, and asked the secretary to rectify this.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs T Tongwane (ANC) proposed the adoption of the minutes and Mr Ramokhoase seconded the proposal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson told the Committee that before the end of July, they had a slot and should use this to brief the Auditor General, and then also do a briefing with the Department on the third and fourth quarter performance.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n\tShe asked if the visit to Ncera Farms would be possible, considering their busy timetable over the next two months.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Committee Secretary said that they would look at the logistics and they needed to apply for political permission. She did not think it would be a problem for the Committee to go as the rules stated that committees could meet whenever they wanted.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson confirmed that the Secretary would inform them if it was logistically possible for them to go the Eastern Cape to visit Ncera Farms. It was important for the Committee to go there before the media did.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tShe said that everyone would be speaking at the debate on 16 July, and that they should attend and represent their constituencies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe meeting was adjourned.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "summary": "<p>Prior to this meeting, the Portfolio Committee on Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries had a meeting in June with the Minister, the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) as well as other entities which play significant roles in &nbsp;the fields of agriculture, forestry and&nbsp; fisheries. During these meetings, the Annual Performance Plan (APP) and the budget proposals of the Department were discussed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe focus of the meeting was the consideration and the adoption of minutes which were written by the Committee Secretary from the previous meeting. The other important focus was on the consideration and adoption of the draft report of the APP and budget proposal of the Department.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n\tThe Committee focused largely on the recommendations in the report. &nbsp;&nbsp;All the Members agreed that the budget allocation was insufficient and proposed that the Department make a case for Treasury to increase the budget and ensure that 10% of the national budget be allocated to the DAFF. The main area of concern related to the possible closing down of Ncera Farms in the Eastern Cape, to which the EFF representative was vigorously opposed. &nbsp;It was argued that Ncera would not be closing down, but would rather be deregistered and transferred to another organisation or entity to run it. This was corrected in the minutes and in the report.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

They may investigate any matter of public interest that falls within their area of responsibility. There is a Portfolio Committee for each national Ministry and its associated government department/s.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Select Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Council of Provinces (NCOP) appoints from its permanent members a number of Select Committees to shadow the work of the various national government departments and to deal with Bills.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause only 54 of the 90 NCOP Members are permanent delegates compared to the 400 of the NA, the Select Committees oversee the work of more than one national government department.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Public Accounts Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Assembly Standing Committee on Public Accounts acts as Parliament&#39;s watchdog over the way taxpayers&#39; money is spent by the Executive. Every year the Auditor-General tables reports on the accounts and financial management of the various government departments and State institutions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHeads of government departments and institutions are regularly called by this committee to report and account for expenditure. The Committee can recommend that the National Assembly takes corrective actions if necessary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Members&#39; Legislative Proposals and Petitions Committees</strong><br />\r\nDraft bills can be submitted by individual Members of the National Assembly. These bills are considered by the National Assembly&#39;s Standing Committee on Private Member&#39;s Legislative Proposals and Special Petitions. If the Committee agrees with the principle of the draft Bill, a Bill will be prepared and dealt with by Parliament.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe National Council of Provinces Select Committee on Members&#39; and Provincial Legislative Proposals considers draft Bills from individual NCOP members and provincial legislatures.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPetitions may also be tabled in Parliament and referred to the relevant committee that deals with the issue raised in the petition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Internal Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Assembly has a number of internal committees that deal with matters affecting the running of Parliament. The Committees normally consist of senior Members of Parliament. The Rules Committee and its sub-committees deal with House rules, the budget of the House, support for Members, internal arrangements, and powers and privileges of members. Other internal Committees are the Programme Committee that plans the work of the Assembly, the Disciplinary Committee, and the Committee of Chairpersons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe National Council of Provinces has its own domestic Committees. The Rules Committee and its subcommittees deal with the NCOP rules, the NCOP budget, parliamentary privileges, internal arrangements, international relations and delegated legislation. The Programme Committee plans the work of the NCOP and the Committee of Chairpersons make recommendations about the functioning of Committees and other NCOP forums.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Ad hoc Committees</strong><br />\r\nParliament or one of its Houses may appoint an ad hoc (temporary) Committee when a special task must be done.

        "body": "<p><strong>Introduction of Agenda and Committee Concerns</strong><br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson opened the meeting by asking Members to look at the agenda and confirm it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs A Steyn (DA) asked if this was the only day that the Committee would meet, because in the past even three days has not been enough time to discuss the budget and the strategic plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson explained that the Committee was under pressure from Parliament to have the budget approved on time, so the Committee could not have more meetings on it. However, in future, Parliament will consider whether the Committee can have more days as well as consider if the Committee should have more briefings. She also noted that Ms Steyn was a parliamentary veteran and knew best, but this time [due to it being an election year], the Committee would have to comply.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Steyn said that the reason was understandable but it was a pity, because the committee only sees the entity one time during the year. She then shifted the Committee&rsquo;s attention to the issue of Abalone fishing rights which would come to an end at the end of July, and it was a puzzle that the Committee had to solve. She was worried that these fishing rights would expire at the end of the month, and there would be no solution for those who needed the rights.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson responded that the Committee should not rush the agenda. The Committee had to allow the Department to brief Members, and if there were any issues that the Department failed to report on, then the Committee could ask for a briefing on the outstanding issue.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Z Mandela (ANC) suggested that questions should be written and passed along to the Committee Secretary, then to the Chair, so that Members can be aware of the question beforehand and have a more productive meeting.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson agreed with Mr Mandela that issues that need to be raised by the Committee can be added to the agenda. It would also help the researchers prepare before attending the meeting. She then shifted the attention to attendance, and said that there was one apology from Mr M Filtrane (UDM).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr C Maxhegwana (ANC) asked if there was a reason for the Member&rsquo;s absence. Members should be more specific when giving their apologies because the Committee had to know if there are committee schedule clashes. If there are any scheduling problems, the Member had to let the Committee know so that they could deal with this as soon as possible.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr T Ramokhoase (ANC) agreed that Members had to clarify if they had scheduling problems. He was also affected by scheduling clashes because he has another committee meeting, has no alternate to replace him, and had to leave at ten that morning.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson responded that she did not know why the Member did not attend, because he did not give a reason with his apology. Parliament was trying to allocate committee dates so that Members did not have scheduling clashes. That is why the Agriculture Portfolio Committee met on Tuesday. If the designated day clashed with other committees, then there was a problem, which she believed could be corrected. They would deal with that at another time, because this meeting was about the legacy report and the analysis of the sector. Once the Committee had familiarised itself with the challenges that the Committee had to face, then the Committee could figure out scheduling concerns. She did not want to be in a situation where the Committee gets stuck going over the same issues because of poor attendance. If the schedules are not coordinated properly, the Committee would not move forward.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Maxhegwana said that the current meeting was very important, that the Committee did not have a lot of time and so Members must be on time. Further, to manage time properly, Members must be clear on the reason why they cannot attend meetings.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson agreed that the reasons had to be more detailed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Steyn reiterated that the Committee had not been given enough time to prepare, and requested that the entities return the following week.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson responded that the Committee had noted Ms Steyn&rsquo;s concern, and said they all wished that they had enough time.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Committee Secretary introduction</strong><br />\r\n\tMs Albertina Kakaza introduced herself as Committee Secretary and she provided procedural advice. The purpose of meeting is to brief the Members on the last Parliament and its Legacy Report. Overall, her job was to coordinate meetings, organise oversight visits, workshops and so on. Her other role is to monitor the budget of the Committee in consultation with the Chairperson. She also facilitates decision making in the Committee. If anyone needs official documents that are adopted by the Committee, she will have them in her database. She explained that the Committee must vote and adapt the department budget by 11 July 2014. Once the process has been finalised, the adopted budget will be published and debated in the House. Normally the process may include public participation, however, because of the 2014 timeframe, she did not think that there would be enough time for public participation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Content Advisor presentation</strong><br />\r\n\tMs Nokuzda Mgxashe, Committee Content Advisor, provided an overview of the issues facing the sector. One of these is food insecurity, which can be resolved through growing the area of Agriculture. However, an even bigger problem was the alignment of the Agriculture, Fishery and Forestry sectors. The sectors were merged in 2009, and there have been issues coordinating efforts across the sectors. This affects programmes like the Integrated Food Security Strategy (IFSS), which has not been effectively implemented due to lack of coordination to maximise outcome. Another important challenge is that the Department does not have a specific policy when dealing with Agriculture, Fishery and Forestry. On a strategic side, if they are able to coordinate, one of the sectors that should be emphasised is Agro-processing, meaning turning the Agricultural, Fishery and Forestry industries into commercial enterprises. However, for programmes to be successful the Department not only needs to work as a whole, but also needs to face external threats such as climate change, land encroachment, especially from the mining sector, and competition in international trade. To overcome these challenges, strategic plans are needed to combat each threat. For example, for climate change, the government can set up programmes to help farmers assimilate the new weather patterns. For international trade, the government needs to explore commodities and Agro-processing. For example, olive oil has increased its value in the global market, making it an important commodity to explore. She emphasised the need to fix programmes where the benefactors were not benefiting from the mentorship programmes. In conclusion, unless agriculture reaches some degree of commercialisation, South Africa will have problems with food security and poverty alleviation. The Department should also provide aid for smallholders, and help them grow the agriculture sector.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Committee Researchers presentation</strong><br />\r\n\tMr Joseph Nhlanhla introduced himself as the researcher for fisheries. He highlighted the need for departmental cooperation. When the departments were merged, it became hard to find oversight information on sectors like aquaculture. Another issue is that there has to be more research in aquaculture and fisheries because those sectors need constant monitoring to ensure that they are sustainable. Other issues include a lack of policy in the Fisheries sector. For example, the only legislation is the Sea Fishery Act and the Marine Living Resources Act. However, these Acts are concerned with preservation, instead of challenges such as job creation and promoting fishery. This lack of policy has affected the fishery sector, in that allocation of rights and resources are unclear and has become troublesome. For example, there was a controversy in 2013 with rights allocation for nine or eight fisheries. The Department was taken to court over misallocation of fishery rights. The affected fisheries argued that the Department had not consulted them when creating policies, and the Department mishandled the process. The Department released its decisions on the granting of rights on 31 December 2013, giving them a day to look at the decision and appeal, because the next financial cycle began on 1 January 2014. He emphasised that this was a failure on the Department&rsquo;s side because there should be a process, where the fisheries are given ample time to appeal the Department&rsquo;s decision, a process that takes more than a day. Also, due to because of lack of policy and guidelines, the Department does not have reliable oversight or procedures to assess if fishing rights should be granted. It is estimated that this will take up to three years. As such, the Department needs to create guidelines, where a ten-year permit is audited on the fifth year, so that the 2013 problem does not occur again.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnfortunately, there are already eight additional sectors whose permits will either expire next June or December. The Committee needs to play an active role in these fishing rights, because there are people whose livelihoods depend on it. If they have no licences, some people will not have food on the table. More urgently, the Abalone sector&rsquo;s rights expire at the end of July, but there is no policy in place to review whether they should receive fishing rights. It seems that the Department is not paying attention to this, because there are only 103 people affected by the decision. However, it is worth mentioning that the sectors that are supposed to be allocated next year are high value sectors, which will affect food security in the coastal communities.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnother issue with food security and sustainability is research and patrolling vessels. There were previous problems with the functionality of those vessels, which affected research and development. When there are emergencies such as oil spills, those vessels are supposed &ldquo;to spring into action,&rdquo; yet that did not happen because they were in disrepair. Contracts have been made to maintain the vessels, however, some are still not functional. In conclusion, aquaculture is something that the Department needs to work on growing. South Africa is not doing as well as other African countries; some are about to overtake South Africa in terms of production. South Africa was in the top five, but now it is nine of ten in the entire continent. Lastly, there needs to be more infrastructure and there should be more oversight on the Department.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDue to time constraints, the committee researcher dealing with agriculture, Ms Nontobeko Qwabe, could not present. She noted that the Content Advisor had given a broad overview of the sector and she would answer any questions that the Members might have.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong><em>Discussion</em></strong><br />\r\n\tMr Ramokhoase said that it was clear that the Content Advisor&rsquo;s presentation was of a very high level, and it was evident that it covered everything. However, as politicians, the Members deal with political matters. Politicians come up with responses to political questions. The issue of departmental integration was very strong in the presentation. His question then would be, do they have a general strategy? He asked if there was advice on how to solve the specific problem that had been detected. The mentorship programmes where the benefactors did not benefit, that is a real problem. He asked if there is a locality where they can see the problem firsthand. The programme has been in place for over 20 years now, and government has lost substantial amounts of money. Had the researchers found the reason that the programmes are not successful? He wanted to know what went wrong. The Members need to be able to come up with solutions, if the problem is management by officials. Additionally, small-scale farmers are not mentioned as the centre of the issue, when surveys have shown that poverty is found more in rural areas. He asked what Members could do to better allocate funds to government plans. He asked if there were any deadlines for finalising draft policies, because according to what the Committee saw, there have been drafts for so long, but no deadline.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Steyn referred to land reform, she said that people could not manage what they could not measure. One of the biggest challenges facing the Committee is that there is so much that it does not know. In the first presentation, some of the biggest issues deal with not having a baseline. A baseline should be a priority for the Committee. The Committee needed to know actual facts. If the Department is moving forward with food security, the Committee cannot know if there is progress if they do not have statistics. Statistics were needed in the presentation, because there were massive statistical gaps. She could not remember the actual figure, but the figure for subsistence farmers is three million. Even if a farmer has only three chickens, they qualify as a subsistence farmer, making oversight of subsistence farmers hard to gauge. The Committee needed more guidance. If there are so many things that they do not know, they cannot gauge if South Africa is moving forward or backwards.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn a different point, something that comes up during discussions is marginal land in formal homeland areas. She wanted a closer look into that because the information the Committee had was from the &#39;60s and &#39;70s. However, there were instances when the land itself was not marginal land. The land became marginal land through population growth and overuse. She sometimes got the impression that people on those lands think that they cannot plant on those lands, but that perception is not necessarily true. As such, the Committee should look at which land is marginal land and which is not, and find a way to distinguish good soil from bad soil. For example, in the Western Cape, there is land that looks bad yet people are producing wine. So the Committee must get an understanding of what is proper and improper land. Lastly, it is important that the Committee has accessibility to documents. The Department&rsquo;s website is a mess and there are many documents and policies that she could not find on the websites. Even if the Department moans about it, the committee is doing oversight.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Maxhegwana thanked the staff but said that the staff must do more. There is a lot of work to do and the Committee must improve on what has been done in the past. When the staff presented, they spoke about the things that have not been done. It is necessary for the staff to package all the issues for the committee because that will help the Committee improve on what has been done in the past. Lack of management is one of the reasons that things did not function properly in the past. The Department is the implementer, the committee staff finds fault at the lower level, but not the higher level. That needs to be improved. He asked the Content Advisor to be clear on what she meant when she said talked about job creation in the different sectors. She needed to clarify if the definition of employees meant permanent or temporary workers. Farming is an area that needs careful attention, so the Committee really needs to look at the status of temporary workers. Those statistics need to be precise. He then shifted his focus to the area of subsistence fisheries. Small villages must be given space for fishing. He hoped that the Committee would properly address issues like subsistence fisheries. However, the point is to have a document package of what has to be done as quickly as possible. The Committee cannot have things like the Department&rsquo;s website not working properly. Members must have access to information.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Mandela asked about the gap between the sector&rsquo;s direct and indirect effect on employment. Asked if those employees were permanent or temporary workers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Steyn asked about the outstanding forestry and fisheries legislation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson thanked the staff for the informative presentation. She emphasised that the Department needs to give the Committee all relevant documents. She pointed out that the water rights of small farmers had not been mentioned. She asked if the staff had any information on that. The Committee needed to ensure funding for small sectors to grow. For example, land and rural development was important. When she was in Limpopo she noticed that most of the restituted land is not used. Intergovernmental legislation will be very helpful in that area. Staff must tell the Committee about the transformational issues. Most important is how the Department aligns its policies with the United Nations (UN) and the President&rsquo;s State of the Nation Address (SONA). The Committee will be able to do things right if it gets the right support from the staff. She agreed with Ms Steyn, that the Committee cannot assess progress if there is no data. Furthermore, support given to the provinces cannot be firm if it is not guided. A lot of conditional grants have not been spent, so if there is need to call provinces and get them to Parliament to account for themselves, the Committee must do what needs to get done. The Committee needs to make sure that it assists the Department in getting provinces to do the work properly.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Nontobeko Qwebe began with Mr Ramokhoase&rsquo;s questions. In terms of farming profiling of land, they can look at the best crops to use in the area. Private sector companies successfully use the system developed by the State, which shows that the State is not using the resources properly. For matters such as animal disease, National Treasury has approved a grant to refurbish infrastructure. A lot can be done to improve the livestock and compete with international competitors. On Ms Steyn&rsquo;s questions, she said that the Committee could work with certain estimates, which are reliable. However, there needs to be oversight and management. For example, there are estimates that show that the Department plans to aid 400 000 subsistence farmers, so what happens to the other two million. Further, after three years of aid for a farmer, the State should see the farmer engaging in the commercial sector. The agriculture sector has the ability to lift people out of poverty, so the problem is not the programmes. The Comprehensive Agricultural Support Programme (CASP) is a good programme. The issue is implementation. The Department needs more motivation on the implementation of the programme. Government has spent millions on CASP but the issue is the effect it has on the ground and the way that it is implemented. Maybe people don&#39;t work as hard on holding the farmer&rsquo;s hand. Part of the problem is people who received money in 2004, are not there now, they have left to work as domestic workers elsewhere. The vision that we have and how we implement the programme cannot be perpetual. In terms of draft legislation, they have been in draft since 2009. People have been contracted to aid the department, but the Department has not tabled that plan to the Committee. However, the Department should be answering for issues in the legislation. To respond to about forestry, the National Forest Amendment Bill should be presented to the Committee this year, but she cannot be sure. In terms of the South African Development Community (SADC) and the African Union (AU) commitments, there should be integration. This integration was talked about in the President&rsquo;s SONA. For example, the issue of citrus; it is increasingly difficult to access European markets. South African farmers may not be able to meet the European requirements, but there is an outlet for their produce if South Africa expands to other parts of the African continent. If the farmers produces, but there is no demand, he ends up selling on the side of the road, which is not bad, but limiting. On water availability, if more hectares of agricultural production become active, there will be an issue with having sufficient water. Fracking has a lot of demanding consequences on water. As for water use licences, the Water and Sanitation Department has been very effective in granting the licences. Once a person receives a licence for one purpose, they simultaneously get the water use licence. This might be useful when looking at land rights. Land has been transferred to new owners, but water rights are still with the previous owners - that needs to be addressed. Climate change needs to be addressed as there can be innovation in the area of agriculture. The Committee might want to look at crops that require less water. In terms of comparative advantage, the Committee must look at what South Africa is growing. The Committee can look at groups of farmers to better gauge how much and what South Africa is growing. The whole point is to improve people&rsquo;s lives. Again on water rights the National Development Plan (NDP) has goals, but those goals need to be managed well. In terms of available financial support, the department needs to be slightly better at coordinating funds.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Mgxashe said that the staff will provide the documents that the Committee needs. Packaging of all issues will be provided as well. The package will be categorised under policies and legislation. Adding to the water rights issue, in terms of innovation, one of the things that has not been tapped is water harvesting. The Land Bank used to report to agriculture, but because of mismanagement a decision, which involved a court case, was made in July 2008, where the bank was transferred to the National Treasury. The last Committee had been struggling to get the Land Bank to report to it. She suggested an alliance with the Standing Committee on Finance, since they have access to the Land Bank. However, there will be challenges due to differing goals. The Land Bank is commercially oriented, but it is meant to help financially disadvantaged farmers. In conclusion, the bank is commercial in that it tried to professionalise the lending process to ensure that the people they assist are successful. This is opposed to other policies where they lend people money, even if their enterprise does not seem promising. In terms of legislation amendments, the Department of Environmental Affairs administers legislation such as the Marine Resources Act. As such, implementation across departments will prove to be a challenge.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn Ms Steyn&rsquo;s question on marginal lands, the point is not so much about quality but about things like water and infrastructure; those are the issues that make land marginal land. In some cases, degradation has been high, and so special analysis will be necessary to properly assess this. As for deadlines, some policies do have deadlines, but others do not have specific deadlines.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn issue that Mr Mandela raised, with small-scale producers, the issue is one that has complicated definitions. She felt that the sector needed intervention. There are people who are between small-holder farmer and subsistence farmer. There are people who harvest as subsistence farmers, but one year they do really well, and then they must sell or decide to go bigger. In some African countries, they do have a specific definition for those farmers, but in South Africa the focus is on rural development. In addition one has communal farming communities, which makes categorisation hard. On the question of how to better handle mentorships, some are working, others not. Whether they work depends on the capacity of the Department. In some mentorship programmes, the mentor is the previous holder of the farm and so the mentor runs business as usual and does not transfer the skills to the beneficiary. As for the question on employment StatSA should have the answer as to what it means to be a permanent versus a temporary worker.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson thanked the presenters and the Members and asked if there were any other questions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMs Steyn said that she felt that the Department was too preoccupied on how to spend the money as opposed to making a change. If they report to the Committee every week on how much they spend, and the Committee monitors how they spend the money, the Committee will be able to make a lot of change.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson said that the Committee would look at the analysis by the staff. The Committee&rsquo;s task is to make the Department accountable for the sake of the citizens of South Africa.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe meeting was adjourned.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

She added that it was important that they all worked together as political parties as the Committee was meant to look after food supply for the people. She implored that they do not work with preconceived political ideas but rather on issues that would benefit all communities. She added that they all came from different backgrounds with different ideas hence the need to work together and learn from each other.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson thanked Ms Steyn and gave assurance that they would all work together as a team as long as they followed the rules of Parliament. She added that the Legacy Report and other documents from the previous Committee would be passed on to Members in order to define the way forward.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr Mandela welcomed the input of Ms Steyn. He said it was the task of the Committee to ensure that agriculture was revolutionalised in all communities of South Africa as it only favored the minority. The Committee should ensure that agriculture was beneficial in all sectors of the country especially the rural areas like Eastern Cape. He looked forward to working with the members of the Committee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr L Ntshayisa (AIC) congratulated the Chairperson on her election and greeted the other members. He said he looked forward to working together with them.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr S Mncwabe (NFP) emphasized that his party, NFP,&nbsp; viewed the Committee on Agriculture as critical because it touched the poor. He added that the Committee should ensure that the youth were enlightened that agriculture was not meant for the elderly only, but for the youth as well.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson commented that agriculture was an important area in the country as the Department on Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) had launched Fetsa Tlala. She added that members would need the Legacy Report and documents of the previous committee and there would be a session to peruse how the previous committee had worked and the way forward. She reminded members of the budget training on 25 June.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMr B Joseph (EFF) asked when the Legacy Report and documents would be received by the members.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chairperson replied that the reports would be provided before the day ended by the secretary.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe meeting was adjourned.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Committee meetings are open to the public, but may be closed if there is a good reason to do so.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>The different committees have one or more of the following functions:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>They monitor and oversee the work and budgets of national government departments and hold them accountable They consider and amend Bills, and may initiate Bills They consider private members&#39; and provincial legislative proposals and special petitions They consider international treaties and agreements They examine specifi c areas of public life or matters of public interest They take care of domestic parliamentary issues Committees have the power to summon any person to appear before them, give evidence or produce documents. They may require any person or institution to report to them. Committees may also receive petitions, representations or submissions from the public. Each Committee is headed by a Chairperson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>THE DIFFERENT COMMITTEES OF PARLIAMENT</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Portfolio Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Assembly (NA) appoints from among its members a number of Portfolio Committees to shadow the work of the various national government departments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>The role of Portfolio Committees is to:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>consider Bills, deal with departmental budget votes, oversee the work of the department they are responsible for, and enquire and make recommendations about any aspect of the department, including its structure, functioning and policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe work of Committees is not restricted to government. They may investigate any matter of public interest that falls within their area of responsibility. There is a Portfolio Committee for each national Ministry and its associated government department/s.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Select Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Council of Provinces (NCOP) appoints from its permanent members a number of Select Committees to shadow the work of the various national government departments and to deal with Bills.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause only 54 of the 90 NCOP Members are permanent delegates compared to the 400 of the NA, the Select Committees oversee the work of more than one national government department.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Public Accounts Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Assembly Standing Committee on Public Accounts acts as Parliament&#39;s watchdog over the way taxpayers&#39; money is spent by the Executive. Every year the Auditor-General tables reports on the accounts and financial management of the various government departments and State institutions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHeads of government departments and institutions are regularly called by this committee to report and account for expenditure. The Committee can recommend that the National Assembly takes corrective actions if necessary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Members&#39; Legislative Proposals and Petitions Committees</strong><br />\r\nDraft bills can be submitted by individual Members of the National Assembly. These bills are considered by the National Assembly&#39;s Standing Committee on Private Member&#39;s Legislative Proposals and Special Petitions. If the Committee agrees with the principle of the draft Bill, a Bill will be prepared and dealt with by Parliament.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe National Council of Provinces Select Committee on Members&#39; and Provincial Legislative Proposals considers draft Bills from individual NCOP members and provincial legislatures.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPetitions may also be tabled in Parliament and referred to the relevant committee that deals with the issue raised in the petition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Internal Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Assembly has a number of internal committees that deal with matters affecting the running of Parliament. The Committees normally consist of senior Members of Parliament. The Rules Committee and its sub-committees deal with House rules, the budget of the House, support for Members, internal arrangements, and powers and privileges of members. Other internal Committees are the Programme Committee that plans the work of the Assembly, the Disciplinary Committee, and the Committee of Chairpersons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe National Council of Provinces has its own domestic Committees. The Rules Committee and its subcommittees deal with the NCOP rules, the NCOP budget, parliamentary privileges, internal arrangements, international relations and delegated legislation. The Programme Committee plans the work of the NCOP and the Committee of Chairpersons make recommendations about the functioning of Committees and other NCOP forums.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Ad hoc Committees</strong><br />\r\nParliament or one of its Houses may appoint an ad hoc (temporary) Committee when a special task must be done. When the task is complete, the Committee is dissolved.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Joint Committees</strong><br />\r\nThe National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces together appoint a number of joint committees, for example the Constitutional Review Committee.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and the Joint Standing Committee on Defence are statutory Committees. This means that they are established, by the Constitution or by an Act of Parliament, as well as in terms of the rules of Parliament.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe committees play a very important role in the process of building democracy and involving the public in the processes and activities of Parliament.</p>\r\n",
