# INSTALL
#
# Mzalendo is mostly a standard Django project. There are some unusual
# dependencies that are noted below.

# The lines without a '#' at the start are commands to run on your command line


# WHERE TO PUT THE CODE
# 
# In addition to the downloaded code several other directories are needed for
# dynamic data such as the search indexes, uploaded images, various caches etc.
# 
# These extra directories are by default put alongside the folder containing the
# code. To keep these from getting mixed up with other directories on your
# computer we suggest you create a folder called mzalendo_root for them all to
# reside in.

mkdir mzalendo_root
cd mzalendo_root


# GETTING THE CODE
# 
# The code is available via github: https://github.com/mysociety/mzalendo

git clone https://evdb@github.com/mysociety/mzalendo.git

# on a Mac you could fetch the code using GitHub's client - use the 'Clone in
# Mac' button - http://mac.github.com/


# NON-PYTHON DEPENDENCIES

# There are some dependencies that need to be installed. Please see the
# 'conf/packages' file for details.

# You will also need the yuglify css and js compressor
npm install yuglify

# DATABASES

# A Postgis enabled Postgres database is required

# create the database - assuming here that you're calling it 'mzalendo'
createdb -T template_postgis mzalendo


# CONFIGURATION FILES

# go to the mzalendo Django project
cd mzalendo

# copy config example and set values needed
cp conf/general.yml-example conf/general.yml
nano conf/general.yml


# PYTHON DEPENDENCIES AND DATABASE SETUP

# Most of this is done using the 'bin/prepare_environment.bash' script. This
# will create the virtual environment, install needed python dependencies and
# then set up the database
bin/prepare_environment.bash

If this step fails, please consult TROUBLESHOOTING.txt

# VIRTUALENV

# now that the environment has been created you need to enable it
source ../mzalendo-virtualenv/bin/activate


# START THE DEV SERVER

# The dev server will allow you to check that everything is working as expected.

cd mzalendo
./manage.py runserver

# don't forget to log in to the admin and change the entry in 'sites' to your
# machine's hostname and port



# Get Busy!
