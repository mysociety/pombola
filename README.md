## Future

The Pombola codebase was originally written for the Kenyan site
[mzalendo.com](http://info.mzalendo.com). It has since been modified to support
other sites around the world, notably several in Africa.

We want the code to be easy to use for other installations, but currently there are some rough edges.

of Pombola possible, in particular the generous support from:

* [The Omidyar Network](https://www.omidyar.com/)

Thanks also to [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/) who

also does the courtesy of offering the source code to their users.

Why not use the GPL? The GPL guarantees that anyone who gets a binary
version of the software also gets the source code so they can modify
it. Since users of websites never get the binary, just HTML pages, it
is no better a license than a BSD style license would be for them.
